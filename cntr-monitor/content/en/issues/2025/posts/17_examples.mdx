AI has already been used occasionally in monitoring missions or is considered for future verification:

- The United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) “[used] machine learning to analyze radio data to detect hate speech, serving as an automated early-warning system for unrest” and social media was monitored with AI in the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) “to identify perceptions of the Mission to improve service”.[^1]
- The IAEA has expressed interest in AI applications in nuclear safeguards implementations and conducts research in this field, e.g. to support inspectors and analysts in reviewing surveillance.[^2] The successful application of AI techniques to identify changes at nuclear facilities with satellite imagery was demonstrated as part of a project that also developed a Big Data pipeline for automatic data processing in the context of IAEA safeguards.[^3]
- In order to find “approaches for using AI to enhance the effectiveness of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), efficiency, and preparedness”, the OPCW has sought research proposals.[^4]
- Various types of cameras, acoustic and other sensors as well as drone footage were used in combination by the Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine, motion sensors by United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) or radars by MINUSMA.[^5] At least for the SMM, allocating sufficient personal resources needed for analyzing the data was difficult.[^6] Artificial Intelligence may help solve this issue.
- Besides international organizations, AI is also applied in the civil society open-source intelligence (OSINT) community. For instance, Forensic Architecture used ML classifiers to search for Russian tanks in social media footage of the 2014 Battle of Ilovaisk and provide proof of the direct military involvement of Russia in Ukraine.[^7] A Swansea University-led initiative uses AI to search for instances of BLU-63 (a cluster ammunition) in footage from the civil war in Yemen,[^8] while the investigative journalism platform Bellingcat has developed an AI image classification tool for their collaborators.[^9]
