<Leadin>A 300-page technical</Leadin> report released in December 2024 warns that creating a “mirrored” organism could cause severe ecological disruptions.<Footnote number="1" /> The authors urge the global research community, policymakers, funders, industry, civil society, and the public to engage in broader discussions to determine a responsible path forward.

To understand why such concerns are being raised, it is essential to grasp the basic science behind mirror life, starting with chirality. All organisms on Earth contain chiral molecules that are often compared to human hands since they come in left-handed and right-handed forms. Just like our hands, which are mirror images of each other but remain misaligned no matter how we rotate them, chiral molecules also cannot be perfectly superimposed. Chiral molecules like DNA, RNA, and amino acids are all found only in one chiral form in life on Earth. While one of these molecules might fit perfectly into the <Term t="rezeptor">receptor</Term>, the other will not.

This significant difference between the two chiral versions of a molecule can be illustrated by the example from the 1950s and 1960s with the development of the drug Thalidomide. Widely prescribed to pregnant women for the treatment of morning sickness, Thalidomide was later found to be a mixture of chiral molecules. While the left-handed version was effective, the right-handed version proved highly toxic, leading to the thousands of children worldwide with severe birth defects.<Footnote number="2" />

## Chiral Molecules: From Discovery to Dilemma

In 2016, scientists succeeded in creating a mirror image of a <Term t="polymerase">polymerase</Term>.<Footnote number="3" /> At the time, the researchers were excited about the advancements, describing it as a milestone that would bring them closer to creating the mirror-image of an entire cell. Other than just pure scientific curiosity, the development could mean new opportunities in materials science, fuel synthesis, and pharmaceutical research. For example, mirror-image peptides (D-peptides) are being developed because they resist natural enzymes, an approach used in some cancer drugs and antimicrobial agents.

However, with the discovery of mirror life has come the recognition that there is nothing on earth that can limit the reproduction of mirror life (e.g., diseases or <Term t="bacteriophage">bacteriophages</Term>). Initially, it might have been considered a selling point that the body cannot break down these mirror-version proteins and molecules, but this same incompatibility with natural life is now causing alarm in scientific community. Early enthusiasm was supported by grants, such as an almost 3-million USD grant in 2019, for “Collaborative Research: Booting up a Mirror Cell”.<Footnote number="4" /> The grant abstract states that “[f]rom an applied perspective, the work could enable the production of entirely new classes of materials and mirror drugs endowed with improved stability and activity. Creating substances that were previously impossible to create will lead to the next-generation of renewable biotechnology and medical products.” The researchers promised to develop a foundation for mirror cells through different activities, such as “developing schemes for chemically synthesizing mirror biomolecules; repurposing the natural biological machinery to synthesize mirror nucleic acids and proteins; developing a computational framework for predicting the physiological impact of alternative chirality”.

Now, several previously optimistic researchers have changed their minds about the risks and advantages of mirror life. While most experts predict that mirrored organisms are still decades from becoming a reality, a report published in December 2024<Footnote number="5" /> raises an early warning. The 300-page report, titled “Technical Report on Mirror Bacteria: Feasibility and Risks,” is accompanied by a *Science* article<Footnote number="6" /> from more than 30 authors in 10 countries. The report outlines the potential harms of mirrored life but uses speculative language throughout, with terms like “may” and “possible”.<Footnote number="7" /> This emphasizes that there is no clear understanding of how a mirrored organism would spread, its potential infectiousness or lethality to natural life, or whether and how it could be contained. The report also highlights the concern that, with their opposite chirality, robust mirror bacteria could in principle evade immune defenses, resist predators, and infect a wide range of hosts across diverse environments. Even though the timeline for the creation of mirror bacteria remains uncertain, the *Science* article’s authors emphasize that now is the right moment to anticipate and mitigate risks, before they materialize.

## Building a Mirror Cell – Scientific Challenges and Requirements

<Aside>For more information on DNA synthesis, see the [chapter “DNA Synthesis Screening”](/en/2025/dna-synthesis-screening/).</Aside>

There is no simple way to build a mirror cell. While a few scientists speculate that partial systems or basic mirror-life components might emerge within a few years, the majority believe that constructing a complete, self-sustaining mirror organism will likely require at least a decade of further research and technological advances. Even the simplest bacterial cell is a complex system, requiring protein-assembling machinery, as well as synthesis of a mirrored genome from <Term t="nucleo">L-nucleotides</Term>. The chemical synthesis of short D-oligonucleotides (such as D-DNA and D-RNA), which occur naturally, has become fairly routine. However, constructing an entire genome composed of mirror-image nucleotides presents a significantly greater challenge.

Another major challenge is building a mirrored <Term t="ribosome">ribosome</Term>. Ribosomes are complex biomachines used by all organisms to build proteins based on genetic instructions in their DNA. They are made up of several individual proteins and RNA pieces, each of which is crucial for correct functioning. Assembling a functioning mirror-ribosome in a test tube is neither easy nor cheap. However, the cost barrier is gradually diminishing, a trend shared with other advancements in biotechnology.<Footnote number="8" />

## Balancing Innovation and Biosecurity

Science often faces a key dilemma: whether to advance progress or pause to prevent potential risks – a debate with a long historical precedent. As scientists work to better understand the risks of mirror life, several experts have called for a pause on mirror life research, including halting funding and refraining from launching new projects.<Footnote number="9" />

<Aside>Physical and biological containment strategies can reduce risks, but cannot eliminate them entirely.</Aside>

If mirror bacteria are created, it could become possible to develop more robust and diverse strains, raising significant biosafety and biosecurity concerns. Scientists worldwide work with dangerous pathogens in safe laboratories, designated by their BSL (Biosafety Level). BSL4 labs are used to study airborne pathogens and toxins that cause deadly diseases with no available vaccine or treatment. These labs are highly safe but are still susceptible to accidents. Considering the potential risks of such escape, physical containment alone would be insufficient for experiments with such biological agents. Biological containment methods that engineer organisms to depend on specific (bio)chemicals for growth<Footnote number="10" /> could offer additional security but are currently insufficient to provide a robust guarantee. Such containment strategies can reduce risk, but they are not foolproof, because organisms may evolve to overcome engineered dependencies, or environmental factors might inadvertently supply the required chemicals.

Our understanding of how mirror organisms would interact with ecosystems remains limited. Evolution may yield unexpected adaptations, and disruptions to nutrient cycles, microbial competition, or chemical balances could have ripple effects. This recognition echoes the 1975 Asilomar Conference, as well as “The Spirit of Asilomar” summit (February 2025), where scientists reaffirmed that research with marginal benefit but high risk deserves restraint. More recently, the Paris Conference on Risks from Mirror Life (June 2025, Institut Pasteur) brought renewed urgency to this debate.

Given ongoing uncertainties and potential consequences, mirror life research calls for sustained oversight, transparent global dialogue, and continuous risk evaluation before further advancement. Some experts have proposed a complete moratorium on mirror life research, including halting funding and suspending new projects, to allow time for thorough ethical reflection, international dialogue, and careful examination of potential risks and benefits. Others believe research could continue under strict conditions, provided that comprehensive international biosafety and biosecurity standards are developed to regulate laboratory containment, prevent environmental release, and establish clear governance and accountability measures. In addition, there is strong support for implementing monitoring and risk assessment programs that include independent scientific review, transparent public reporting, and mechanisms for ongoing reassessment of ecological and societal risks. Such programs should also include early warning systems to detect unintended outcomes or breaches of containment.
