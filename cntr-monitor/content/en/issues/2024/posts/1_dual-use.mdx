title: 'Focus: Perspectives on Dual Use'
intro: The concept of dual use—the fact that many goods serve civilian and military applications—is not new. However, with scientific and technological progress, the regulation of the hard- and software that falls into this category is becoming more complex and is increasingly posing challenges for peace and security. The chapters of this issue of the CNTR Monitor highlight some of the more recent developments in artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing, biology, and drones, including those with dual-use potential. This Focus chapter provides the conceptual basis by unpacking the term “dual use” in its many facets.
