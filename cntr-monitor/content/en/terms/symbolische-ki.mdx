Symbolic AI is a top-down approach. It can be used if a fixed and fully known set of rules is available. Using mathematical logic, new knowledge can be generated from the specifications. This is why it is also referred to as “knowledge-based AI.” However, symbolic AI reaches its limits when humans cannot feed it with correct and consistent knowledge. In addition, symbolic AI models cannot process very large state spaces, such as in the example of the board game Go, where there are around 10^170 possible constellations, and therefore cannot be used in such cases.
