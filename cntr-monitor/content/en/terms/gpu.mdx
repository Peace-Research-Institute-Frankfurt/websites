The graphic processing unit (GPU) is a specialized computing chip that was originally developed to accelerate computer graphics and image processing in PCs, smartphones, and games consoles. Due to their ability to calculate algorithms in massive parallel processing, GPUs are also suitable for non-graphical applications such as training neural networks and mining cryptocurrencies. In contrast to the central processing unit (CPU), which can be understood as the control center of a computer, GPUs are generally optimized for continuous operation under full load and generate the commensurate electrical power of several hundred watts, with the corresponding power and cooling requirements. Due to the massive boom, GPUs are also increasingly being optimized specifically for AI applications and produced as complete device units that can be interconnected in hundreds or thousands in specialized data centers. Such device units can achieve continuous power consumption of more than 1,000 watts, which has a significant impact on the power supply and cooling requirements of data centers.
