Decision trees are a type of data structures for storing knowledge in which a tree structure is used as a model to draw conclusions from the observations contained in the training dataset. Learned rules are represented by nodes and branches of the tree and conclusions by its leaves. After training, the model can also be used to explicitly and graphically represent the rules that lead to a decision.
