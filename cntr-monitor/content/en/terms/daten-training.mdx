A current-generation AI is trained with the help of data that have to be tailored to the problem-solving capability to be achieved. These data can be in the form of text, images, videos, or other information. Some of these data are used in the so-called training process, in which the data are incrementally processed by AI, which leads to an adaptation of the applicationâ€™s data storage structure. The rest of the data are then used to check the results of the training process. Due to the importance of the data for the subsequent results of the AI process, the quality and availability of training data plays a significant role. These data are often compiled by specialized companies, curated by hand, and offered on the market as an economic good.
