Artificial intelligence refers to methods from a subarea of computer science that pursue the approach of reproducing the human representation of knowledge or human reasoning on the basis of known facts in computer algorithms and calculations. The best-known form of artificial intelligence is machine learning (ML), in which the rules of data processing—i.e., the generation of a program output based on an input—are not predefined from the outset by the program code, but are learned by the computer itself through a step-by-step process of training. Other AI approaches, such as symbolic AI, decision trees, and evolutionary algorithms, mainly feature in specific applications. Artificial intelligence generally consists of a defined algorithm that specifies how information is processed for learning and a data structure in which the learned knowledge and the identified knowledge contexts are stored.
