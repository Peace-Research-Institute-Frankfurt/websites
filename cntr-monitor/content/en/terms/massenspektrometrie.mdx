An analytical tool used for measuring the mass-to-charge ratio (the ratio of an ionâ€™s mass to its charge) of one or more molecules present in a sample. It does this by ionizing the material in the ionization source and separating the resulting ions in the analyzer according to mass-to-charge ratios. Several different technologies are available for both ionization and ion analysis, resulting in many different types of mass spectrometers with different combinations of these two processes.
