Rather than being trained on natural language, a bio-specific large language model is trained on amino acid sequences or other biological sequences, enabling it to generate biological sequences as outputs. These tools can learn the favorable properties of biomolecules and suggest promising candidates for laboratory testing, reducing the number of tests needed to identify desirable properties. For instance, UniRep assists researchers in engineering proteins based on their function, while ESMFold focuses on structure, both aiding in more efficient design of better therapies and improving protein engineering for more efficient biomanufacturing. These tools are trained on biological data and support the design of new proteins or other biological agents. Examples include RFDiffusion, as well as protein language models such as ProGen2. These have the potential to enable advances in protein engineering and design to solve crucial problems for human health and the environment.
