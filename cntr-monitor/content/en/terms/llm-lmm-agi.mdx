Depending on the type of training data used and the form of possible user interaction of the AI algorithm, a distinction is made between different types. In large language models (LLM), text data are used for training and output. Users therefore chat with the AI algorithm. In large multimodal models (LMM), image, video, and audio data are also used in training and for interaction between AI and the user. In this case, AI is therefore able to process and produce different media. However, given the speed of technological progress, these boundaries are fluid, depending on the requirements of the field of application. The next big step that tech companies are working on is the vision of what has been dubbed artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is no longer optimized to solve a specific problem, but should be a highly flexible artificial system that is equivalent or superior to human cognitive abilities in all areas. An AGI model should be able to adapt to problems and develop solutions without having been specifically trained for them.
