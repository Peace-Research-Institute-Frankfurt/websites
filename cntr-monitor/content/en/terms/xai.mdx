title: XAI – Explainable Artificial Intelligence

Explainable artificial intelligence approaches are intended to counteract the “black box” tendency of machine learning, i.e., the fact that it is not clear why an AI algorithm has reached a certain decision. Although it is technically possible to monitor the internal processing of a query within the model of an AI, no deterministic conclusions can be drawn about the actual reasoning process. It is therefore impossible to explain AI decisions in terms of “for an input (a), the result (b) was generated on the basis of the learned facts (X) and (Y)”, as it is common in human communication. Explainable artificial intelligence approaches are intended to make these chains of reasoning visible as an extension of an AI model.
