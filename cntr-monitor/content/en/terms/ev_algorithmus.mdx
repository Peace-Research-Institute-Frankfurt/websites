Evolutionary algorithms are a variant of what are known as genetic algorithms, i.e., optimization methods based on the principles of natural evolution. With their help, solutions can be optimized on the basis of stochastic processes by emulating mechanisms of natural evolution, such as selection, mutation, crossbreeding, and “survival of the fittest.” Evolutionary algorithms also generate a solution to a problem from within the system rather than predetermining it in a deterministic manner.
