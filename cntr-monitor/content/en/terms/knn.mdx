In artificial neural networks, the functioning of human neuronal cells and their interactions are simulated. Regardless of the actual purpose, the basic technical principle of ANNs is based on a data structure for storing and processing information, similar to the systems used for cloud computing. This data structure is taught using extensive data tailored to the problem-solving capability to be achieved in what is referred to as a training process. The best-known and most important learning method is deep learning (DL). In this process, the structure is incrementally changed until the model, i.e., the finished structure, generates the desired output for an input. This mechanism is capable of processing extensive data and learning complex data patterns and knowledge contexts. Artificial neural networks and deep learning are currently among the most important forms of AI.
