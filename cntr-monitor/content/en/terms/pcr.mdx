A laboratory technique for producing (or amplifying) millions to billions of copies of a specific segment of DNA, which can then be studied in greater detail. For this, PCR primers are needed. These are short, single-stranded segments of DNA that are designed to be complementary to the beginning and end of the target sequence to be amplified.
