Technology that allows parts of the genome to be edited by removing, adding, or altering sections of the DNA sequence. It involves two essential components: a guide RNA to match the target gene and usually CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)â€”an endonuclease (enzyme cleaving the DNA backbone) which causes a double-stranded DNA break, allowing modifications to the genome.
