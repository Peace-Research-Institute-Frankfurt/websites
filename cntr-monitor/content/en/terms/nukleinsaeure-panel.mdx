title: Nucleic acid panel
term_id: nukleinsaeure-panel
---

A diagnostic test that simultaneously examines multiple nucleic acid sequences (DNA or RNA) to detect and identify various organisms or genetic markers within a single sample. This type of test is often used in medical diagnostics to quickly identify the presence of multiple pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, or fungi, or to assess genetic variations related to specific diseases or conditions. Nucleic acid panels provide comprehensive information that can aid in accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of diseases. Unlike with metagenomic analysis, previous knowledge of the (microbial) agent is required.
