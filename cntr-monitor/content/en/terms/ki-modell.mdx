The finished result of the learning phase of an AI algorithm is referred to as a model and contains the relationships learned from the information used in the learning process. However, this knowledge is not available in the form of explicitly deterministic if/then rules, but is implicitly contained in the data structure of the AI algorithm and its internal links. Such an AI algorithm is therefore regarded as a black box whose internal data processing cannot be understood without considerable additional technical effort (known as explainability). Models are either completely learned and ready for productive use or, in the form of what are referred to as “foundation models,” are trained for certain capabilities but still need to be optimized for a specific application context through further learning phases.
