title: New Ways of Working in Academia
intro: 'Agile teams, home office, and Workcation have long been established in many sectors and show: The working culture is changing. But how can academic institutions meet the challenges of the new work environment? With the “WorkNew@Leibniz” project, the Leibniz Association has developed approaches on how modern forms of work in academia can look like and how they can be implemented. PRIF coordinated the project together with two other Leibniz institutes.'

<Leadin>Changes in workplace culture </Leadin>have been accelerating for several years: The digital age requires new dynamics for work, global networking challenges traditional structures, and employees develop new demands – for greater recognition, participation, and individual development. New work concepts address these developments by combining professional and personal self-realization, focusing on the skills, talents, and wishes of employees, and promoting adaptations in the work environment – such as location independence, results-oriented collaboration across departments, and flexible management with flat hierarchies.

Between 2022 and 2024, the “WorkNew@Leibniz” project developed concrete ideas on how this change can be successfully implemented within academia and particularly within the Leibniz cosmos. A total of 15 Leibniz institutes took part in the exchange, which was coordinated by the Leibniz Information Center for Economics (ZBW), the Leibniz Institute for Knowledge Media (IWM) and PRIF. Susanne Boetsch and Petra Schmidt oversaw project management at PRIF.

The project began with workshops to identify key challenges and approaches to modern organizational culture and to develop possible solutions. This formed the basis for the digital platform “WorkNew@Leibniz – New Forms of Work for Academia”. 

Focusing on the three identified dimensions: space, tools and people. The platform collects a variety of contributions, including reports on pilot projects, information on working conditions, and interviews that offer ideas on how academic institutions can continue to remain attractive employers.

The project brought together perspectives from the scientific community and practitioners at various events. For example, employees of the Leibniz Institutes had the opportunity to present and discuss best practice examples at a joint digital lunch as part of the “Cookiebites” event series.

The final event of the project took place on September 26, 2024 at the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum in Frankfurt. Titled “WorkNew Day 3 – AI and New Work: Future Strategies for Scientific Institutions”. The event brought together scientists, administrators, and other interested parties to discuss the project’s results. The focus was on the challenges and opportunities presented by the use of artificial intelligence, such as the automation of work analysis or innovative approaches to recruitment. *(hfr)*

What is gamification? Why do we need “pre-boarding”? And what does role-based working actually mean? “WorkNew@Leibniz” provides tips and background information on its project platform. 

The website was developed in collaboration with the Hochschule für Gestaltung (HfG) Offenbach.
