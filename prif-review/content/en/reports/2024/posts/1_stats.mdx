<Callout eyebrow="Annual Conference" title="Far Away, Yet So Close: Armed Conflict in the Transnational Constellation" expandable={false}>

10 – 11 October 2024, Frankfurt/Main

The conference explored the question of how modern armed conflicts take place in complex transnational constellations. On one hand, wars such as the one in Gaza are fought within limited geographical areas and are embedded in international politics and diplomacy. On the other hand, they also generate global tensions. Hybrid actors such as Hamas are operating on a global scale. Different interpretations of the war polarize expert communities and public discourse, particularly on social media – even in societies not directly affected.

## Dissertations 2024

Academic education and career promotion are of curical importance to PRIF. As a non-university research institute of the Leibniz Association, the doctoral program is entirely dedicated to the Leibniz motto “theoria cum praxi”: a holistic education that enhances competences in scientific and practical areas and opens up promising career prospects.

The three dissertation projects by Jana Baldus, Anna-Katharina Ferl and Sascha Hach deal with current challenges and opportunities of arms control such as normative conflicts in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NVV), the regulation of autonomous weapons systems (AWS) or the emergence of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). More about the dissertations, written as part of the project “Perspectives on Arms Control” in cooperation with the German Federal Foreign Office, can be found in the article ... .

### Dr. Sascha Hach

Rule & Resistance in the Nuclear Order. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons: Product of a Subversive Struggle

<Figure src="assets/Mikhail Polianskii_RGB.png" size="leftMargin" alt="Mikhail Polianskii mit Doktorhut" />

### Dr. Mikhail Polianskii

The cumulative dissertation “Better Shared Than Dead? Russia’s Dissociation from the post-Cold War European Security Order” by Mikhail Polianskii examines Russia’s alienation from the normative framework of European security. Considering the role of European institutions, he argues that they are not only victims of the authoritarian turn of the Kremlin regime, but also causal for the Russian dissociation from the fundamental pillars of the European security architecture.

### Dr. Linda Schlegel

In her dissertation project “Storytelling against Extremism: How insights on narrative persuasion and storytelling can improve theory and practice of digital narrative campaigns against ‘homegrown’ extremism”, Linda Schlegel analyzes how good storytelling strengthens the impact of digital narrative campaigns against extremism. By focusing on digital narratives of violence, she sheds light on an aspect that has received little attention so far.

### Dr. Simone Schnabel

Simone Schnabel’s dissertation „Radicalization of the Marginalized? Dynamics of Islamist Radicalization in Tunisia post-2011“ examined how the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) legitimized their increasing interventions. Focusing on the intervention in Burkina Faso, she analyzes how citizens in the affected countries themselves assessed these interventions.

### Dr. Rebecca Wagner

In her dissertation „The Shrinking of Civic Space in Electoral Processes: Empirical Evidence on Restrictions, Responses, and Electoral Resilience“ Rebecca Wagner analyzes the restrictions on civil society organizations in the electoral context. Based on a case study of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan and a global survey of election observers, she explores how organizations resist these restrictions.
