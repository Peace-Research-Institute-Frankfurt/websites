teaser: 'The research center TraCe investigates whether and how forms of political violence change – for example, in the war between Russia and Ukraine.'
intro: 'The history of modern societies and international relations is usually told as a gradual renunciation of violence. However, there can be no question of an end to political violence. On the contrary, current trends point in the opposite direction: worldwide conflict has increased in intensity again; globalization and technological change make new forms of warlike and terrorist violence possible. These developments point to transformations that challenge existing norms and practices for containing political violence. The research center “Transformations of Political Violence” (TraCe) examines these developments with the aim of identifying the consequences for intra-societal and international peace and developing strategies to contain political violence under changing conditions.'

<Callout eyebrow="Infobox" title="Who is TraCe?" expandable={false}>

The research center “Transformations of Political Violence” is an interdisciplinary research alliance of five Hessian research institutions: In addition to PRIF, Goethe University Frankfurt, Justus Liebig University Giessen, Philipps University Marburg and Technical University Darmstadt are involved. Funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), more than thirty scientists will conduct multi-perspective research on transformations of political violence from 2022 to 2026. Coordination and science communication are located at PRIF.

## Interdisciplinarity in action 

In order to understand, explain and critically question the transformations of political violence, TraCe integrates different disciplinary perspectives, levels of analysis and methods and takes a look at different forms of violence.

<Quote cite="Christopher Daase, PRIF Talk, 23.03.2023">

To be irritated by other disciplines is tremendously important to see new developments.

</Quote>

The center brings together perspectives from political science, sociology, history, law, social anthropology, social psychology, cultural studies, linguistics, and computer science. 

<Quote cite="Astrid Erll, PRIF TALK, 23.03.2023">

With the second, third, fourth, fifth eye, you simply see more, and that is our goal.

Astrid Erll and Christopher Daase, TraCe speakers in the first year of the project, discussed why it is important and exciting to explore transformations of political violence across disciplines with Tina Cramer in the PRIF Talk podcast (in German).

1. Forms: Change and continuity of political violence
2. Institutions: Prevention and legitimation of political violence
3. Interpretations of political violence
4. Synergies
