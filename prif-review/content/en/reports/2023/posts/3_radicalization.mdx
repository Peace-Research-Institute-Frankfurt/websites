eyebrow: Radicalization Research at PRIF
title: Radicalization in the Online Space
intro: Polycrises, polarization dynamics and radicalization tendencies go hand in hand. Whether it is the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine or the war in Gaza – extremist actors seize on these issues and instrumentalize them. Socio-political events are processed in propagandistic material and thus reinforce radicalization dynamics. Virtual worlds are playing an increasingly important role here, as connectivity and reach are increased by Net 2.0. Online radicalization is one of the fields of radicalization research at PRIF, an area that was further expanded in 2023 with the launch of the VORTEX and RadiGaMe projects.

<Leadin>Nowadays, it is well known </Leadin> that extremist propaganda is spread via the internet. Nevertheless, the role of digital media in radicalization processes remains controversial. Some researchers believe that purely virtual radicalization is not possible without analogue contacts and interactions with other radicalized individuals. Others see the virtual space as a possible catalyst that can initiate, support, and deepen radicalization processes. As a rule, researchers assume that an interplay between analogue and digital spaces is crucial for the influence of extremist actors on individuals who become radicalized.

Radicalization and social cohesion is one of the cross-cutting research areas at PRIF. The institute is already represented in the field of radicalization research with the research network  RADIS and the consortium project KURI. In addition, the VORTEX (Coping with Varieties of Radicalization into Terrorism and Extremism) and RadiGaMe (Radicalization on Gaming and Gaming-related Platforms and Messenger Services) projects were launched in 2023.

A strict separation of the online and offline realms is no longer appropriate in today's world. Many people are constantly online, both worlds are inevitably intertwined and interact with each other. This constant presence in the virtual world can help to accelerate radicalization processes. Users can constantly interact with like-minded people in digital spaces and spend time exclusively in virtual worlds in which extremist propaganda is spread and extremist world views are normalized. Virtual games and related communication platforms have an even more immersive character, as they can result in a further merging of the real and virtual worlds through a shared experience and various identification factors. Online games make it possible to form communities that have characteristics that go beyond the entertainment of games. Ideas and inspirations are exchanged within them, forming complex social spaces in which people not only talk about games, but also about culture, politics, and social issues.

But how are video games and related digital communication channels used by radicalized actors to influence individuals? The spectrum of extremist influence is broad. The development of their own video games, the modification of existing video games and propaganda material with references to gaming culture can be used by radicalized individuals and groups to convey extremist agendas. In addition, gaming-related communication platforms are used to convey hate and incitement. This is precisely where the PRIF sub-project in the RadiGaMe network comes in.

Linda Schlegel is a researcher in the research department “Transnational Politics” and the research group “Radicalization”. She leads the RadiGaMe research project together with Julian Junk.

<InterviewQuestion q="So far, the RadiGaMe project is a novelty. How did the project come about?">

Julian Junk: In the aftermath of the attack in Halle, a few public statements were made, including by the then Federal Minister of the Interior Seehofer, that the gaming scene should also be looked at more closely. Shortly before this, we completed the very fascinating research project PANDORA on the connection between online and offline radicalization and mutual references between right-wing extremist and Salafist-jihadist milieus. In this project, we mainly analyzed communication on messenger services such as Telegram. Even then, however, we asked ourselves whether and how communication patterns, access, and opportunities for action for extremist actors as well as the limits and opportunities for prevention in the rapidly growing area of communication in the gaming sector differ from those in other social media. Coordinated by the project partners from TU Berlin, we developed the RadiGaMe network in response to scientific needs and socio-political discourse.

</InterviewQuestion>

<InterviewQuestion q="Why is it important to examine virtual gaming rooms specifically for extremist influences? What are the goals of RadiGaMe?">

Linda Schlegel: We know that extremist actors use digital gaming spaces in a variety of ways. This includes not only the creation of video games, but also the use of gaming and gaming-related platforms such as Steam, Discord or Twitch and attempts to address gamers in chat rooms and disseminate propagandistic content. However, this is a very young field of research that is often based on pilot studies and random findings. There are very few studies that systematically investigate extremist activities and radicalization processes in gaming rooms. RadiGaMe attempts to address this research gap. We focus on the entire spectrum of possible extremist activities on gaming and gaming-related platforms and analyse radicalization processes, group dynamics, the dissemination of criminally relevant content and possibilities for prevention work. The aim is to gain a deeper understanding of radicalization processes and their manifestations in digital gaming spaces in order to be able to identify radicalizing users in a more targeted manner in the future and, if necessary, direct them to extremism prevention actors.

</InterviewQuestion>

<InterviewQuestion q="What challenges does such research face?">

Julian Junk: There's a lot to consider: what data is accessible at all, what data protection and research ethics limits do we have to observe? Mapping these opportunities and limits for research, but also for specialist practice in prevention up to the limits of intervention for law enforcement and security authorities, is uncharted territory in this area. RadiGaMe links various disciplines and also connects research with practical knowledge. Large project networks can be laborious, but they are also essential in order to be able to meet precisely such complex knowledge requirements.

</InterviewQuestion>

<InterviewQuestion q="Are there already initial exploration results and what happens next?">

Linda Schlegel: As a first step, we explored 20 gaming and gaming-related platforms and checked whether and, if so, which extremist content could be found. We mainly found right-wing, far-right, anti-Semitic, racist, and misogynistic content as well as conspiracy narratives. This is hardly surprising considering the current state of research on extremist activities on these platforms, which also largely relates to this type of content. Islamist content is also present on some platforms, albeit often more hidden than content from the right-wing spectrum. In the next step, we will subject a handful of these platforms to a more in-depth analysis in order to trace possible radicalization processes in these digital spaces. We will start with two so-called mod forums, where users can upload and discuss modifications (so-called mods) they have made to well-known video games. We also plan to take a closer look at Roblox and Steam as the project progresses.

<Callout eyebrow="Infobox" title="New Projects in the Research Group Radicalization" expandable={false}>

PRIF is part of the EU-funded Marie Skłodowska-Curie doctoral network VORTEX (Coping with Varieties of Radicalization into Terrorism and Extremism), which comprises eight partners (universities and research institutes) and employs ten doctoral students. The overarching goal of VORTEX is to develop new, evidence-based and innovative strategies to counter radicalization. At PRIF, two doctoral students and their supervisor are part of this network.

The PRIF sub-project of [RadiGaMe](https://www.radigame.de/en/) is embedded in an interdisciplinary research network and investigates forms of communication of radicalized individuals and individuals at risk of radicalization, so-called modes of interaction. It systematically explores the variety of risks that virtual game worlds offer individuals at risk of radicalization and, based on this, develops solutions for law enforcement, early detection and preventive measures.
