title: Coming to Terms with the Past
intro: "Apology? Yes. Compensation? No. Restitution of stolen cultural assets? Yes and no. More development aid? Yes. Reparations? No way. Relations with former colonies are difficult. What are the obstacles in the debates and why is it important to deal with the colonial past in terms of the culture of remembrance? This is the focus of the research project “Evils of a Global Past: Post-colonial Genocide Memory and Glocally Entangled Reconciliation Politics” led by Sabine Mannitz, which has progressed with several publications and events in 2023."
