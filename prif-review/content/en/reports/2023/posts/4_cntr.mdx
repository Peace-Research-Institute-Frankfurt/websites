title: What Does Artificial Intelligence Mean for Arms Control?
intro: Artificial intelligence influences almost all areas of civilian life and the military today. Recent technological advances have demonstrated its transformative potential for society. In particular, the introduction of AI into military use is being discussed in many different ways. While some fear a loss of control due to the human element no longer being necessary, ethical principles are also being renegotiated and there is widespread demand for responsibility. At the same time, the use of AI systems also has the potential to lead to an improvement in arms control. As one of the cross-cutting topics in the Cluster for Natural and Technical Science Arms Control Research (CNTR), AI touches on almost all research topics in the project, which was launched in 2023.
