    "description": "The Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation (HCoC) is a multilateral, voluntary initiative aimed at preventing the spread of ballistic missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Established in 2002, it complements existing non-proliferation measures like the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). The HCoC promotes transparency and confidence-building through annual declarations on ballistic missile and space-launch programs, as well as pre-launch notifications. While not legally binding, it encourages responsible behavior among its 145 subscribing states, serving as a critical tool for global security by fostering dialogue and cooperation to limit the proliferation of missile technologies.",

It aims to promote transparency and responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies, thereby preventing destabilizing accumulations. Participating states implement national policies to ensure that such transfers do not contribute to the development or enhancement of military capabilities that undermine regional and international security. The Arrangement facilitates information exchange on transfers and denials of specified controlled items to non-participating states, enhancing cooperation among members. It is not legally binding and decisions are made by consensus. The Wassenaar Arrangement's Secretariat is located in Vienna, Austria.",
