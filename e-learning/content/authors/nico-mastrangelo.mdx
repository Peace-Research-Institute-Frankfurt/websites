Nico Mastrangelo, a student of PPE, is deeply curious about the world around him. In the context of his career, he has since spent time in various industries, including the Theater, Service, Communications, Journalism, and Reaserch sectors. Currently, as a Project Coordinator at the prestigious Prague Security Studies Institute, Nico has had the wonderful privilege of assisting with various projects; while primarily working within the Economic and Financial Statecraft Program, he jumped at the opportunity to harness his previous skill sets to assemble this learning unit. He hopes you learn as much by listening to it, as he did making it!
