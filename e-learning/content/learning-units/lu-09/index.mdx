intro: "Anti-personnel landmines and cluster munitions have been banned for their harmful effects on civilians. Treaties such as the Mine Ban Treaty (1997) and the Convention on Cluster Munitions (2008) focus on human security, requiring weapon clearance and victim assistance, and inspiring broader humanitarian disarmament efforts"

Anti-personnel landmines and cluster munitions have been banned due to their devastating impact on civilians and the fact that they hinder post-conflict recovery. In the 1980s and 1990s, many civilians were killed or injured by landmines that were remnants of Cold War-era conflicts. This humanitarian crisis prompted a global campaign to ban landmines that shifted the focus from state security to ‘human security’ and led to humanitarian arms control. The 1997 Mine Ban Treaty (MBT) and the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) followed. These treaties ban entire categories of weapons due to their human impact and they require clearance of contaminated areas and victim assistance. They have also inspired efforts to control small arms, nuclear weapons and other means of warfare, thus advancing humanitarian disarmament.

After completing the unit you will be able to:
- identify the key features of humanitarian arms control;
- distinguish between traditional arms control and humanitarian arms control;
- apply a humanitarian framework to analyse conflict and emerging weapons issues;
- understand current challenges to the consolidation and strengthening of humanitarian arms control.
