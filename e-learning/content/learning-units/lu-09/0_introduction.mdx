## What is ‘humanitarian arms control’?

Anti-personnel landmines and cluster munitions have been banned because they take a heavy toll on civilian lives and impede post-conflict reconstruction and development. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, even as Cold War-era conflicts were coming to an end, thousands of civilians were still being killed and maimed by landmines.

It was at this juncture that humanitarian arms control emerged. United Nations officials, NGOs and scholars moved away from an exclusive focus on state security to concentrate on the security of individuals, or ‘human security’, and from arms control focused on preventing great power war to humanitarian arms control aimed at prohibiting weapons that endangered men, women and children in their daily lives. Landmines were referred to as ‘weapons of mass destruction in slow motion’, killing a person every 20 minutes. This humanitarian crisis sparked a civil society campaign that led to the adoption of the Mine Ban Treaty in 1997.

Soon after this, the bombing campaign in Kosovo, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the 2006 Israeli-Lebanon War led to another humanitarian crisis in the making caused by the use of cluster munitions. Cluster munitions contain numerous small submunitions that cover wide areas and often function as landmines due to their high failure rates, thus threatening civilian lives both during and after conflicts. Another NGO campaign helped bring about their prohibition in 2008 with the Convention on Cluster Munitions.

These treaties are hallmarks of humanitarian arms control and disarmament. They look at security and arms control through a humanitarian lens – focusing on the weapons’ effects on human lives and livelihoods and addressing them holistically.

They prohibit the weapons and require states to clear contaminated areas, provide victim assistance and educate people about the risks of these weapons.
The treaties have also prompted efforts to protect civilians against the effects of small arms, nuclear weapons and other means of warfare – initiatives that have advanced the field of humanitarian arms control in a changing international environment.

This unit will introduce you to the problems of anti-personnel landmines and cluster munitions and the legal frameworks that address them. It will help you understand the substance of humanitarian arms control, the dynamics that have led to its rise and its processes of implementation.

  Humanitarian arms control or humanitarian disarmament[^1] includes a number of international treaties that prohibit specific weapons because they are deemed to cause unacceptable civilian harm both during and after the end of armed conflicts. The 1997 Ottawa Convention that bans anti-personnel landmines and the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions are prime examples. One of their distinguishing features is that they are inspired by humanitarian principles and draw on International Humanitarian Law. The protection of innocent human beings takes centre stage rather than the state security interests that were underlying most arms control efforts during the Cold war. This shift towards ‘human security’ happened after the end of the Cold War when there was a hope of ending the arms race and gaining a peace dividend to be channelled into human development.

  In 1994, the UN Development Program (UNDP) was among the first actors to articulate this ‘people-centred’ human security agenda:

  <Quote  fullDocument="" cite='UNDP 1994: 22, 52'>

    The concept of security has for too long been interpreted narrowly: as security of territory from external aggression, or as protection of national interests in foreign policy […] Forgotten were the legitimate concerns of ordinary people who sought security in their daily lives.

    So far, disarmament has focused more on high-technology weapons, when the real problems are small weapons […] [including] one of the worst killers – landmines

  Although the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) had started in 1992, before the UNDP brought human security into focus, it was motivated by the same ideas and showed how the human security agenda can be implemented in practice. The idea of ‘disarmament as humanitarian action’ was developed further at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research[^2] and has influenced a number of initiatives for weapons prohibitions, including those on cluster munitions, nuclear weapons, explosive weapons in populated areas and lethal autonomous weapons, as well as efforts to curb the arms trade, including trade in small arms and light weapons.

  More broadly, we can think of humanitarian arms control as a type of arms control that incorporates humanitarian concerns – avoiding the infliction of unnecessary suffering on combatants and indiscriminate harm on civilians. Such instruments fall within the ambit of international humanitarian law, which regulates the conduct of military operations, and were adopted both before and during the Cold War. Their emphasis on humanitarian values (albeit to differing degrees) distinguishes them from the typical arms control initiatives of the Cold War, which aimed at stabilising relations between the two superpowers by limiting the numbers and types of certain weapons. Thus humanitarian arms control is guided by humanitarian values and focuses on alleviating the suffering of individuals. In contrast, arms control during the Cold War was driven by the strategic and security interests of states, primarily the US and the Soviet Union, and aimed at avoiding a ‘hot’ war between them, or at least at lowering the destructiveness of such a conflict.

Next, I will offer some brief definitions of arms control, elaborate on the main principles of IHL and how it relates to weapons, and highlight the distinctive aspects of humanitarian arms control after the Cold War, the period we usually associate with the beginning of this approach.

## What is arms control?
Arms control can be defined in different ways, some broader, others narrower (see also LU01, LU20). Here, I will adopt a narrow perspective and focus on the measures that prohibit certain weapons, their size, development, production, transfer, stockpiling or use, as well as those that manage, cap or lower weapons numbers.[^3]

<Figure
  src="LU09_inhalte_grafiken_18022025_pfade_5.svg"

These measures can serve different purposes, foremost maintaining state security at a minimal cost, as well as establishing stability in interstate relations, allaying suspicions of aggressive intentions, diminishing the risk of war, or limiting a war’s destructiveness and its harmful effects on people and the environment.

Disarmament is a type of arms control that aims to eliminate certain (or all) weapons or reduce their numbers. While arms control and disarmament are sometimes used together or interchangeably, historically, disarmament was closely aligned with attempts to abolish war itself. Thus disarmament can be seen as antithetical to defence measures, which, from an arms control perspective, are essential for stable interstate relations.

During the Cold War, the two superpowers were the main players in the field of arms control. Arms control was primarily about containing the arms race and achieving stable mutual deterrence.[^4] In the prevailing climate of mutual suspicion, verification measures were important in order to increase the probability of states complying with their treaty obligations and to detect early any cheating.

A strategic balance between the superpowers was established. However, it came at a high cost and with high levels of nuclear armaments, which at their peak in the mid-1980s reached some 70,000 nuclear warheads,[^5] more than half of which were acquired after the start of arms control efforts in the early 1960s. Hence, critics perceived arms control largely as a failure – it maintained the status quo and contributed to militarisation and ever higher defence expenditures.
In sum, during the Cold War, arms control revolved around weapons of mass destruction (WMD), centred on the interests of great powers and was primarily a means to stabilise their relations.

## What is international humanitarian law?
Humanitarian arms control is guided by humanitarian norms and values. These include basic human rights norms that protect the life and dignity of every human being, and importantly, humanitarian principles that apply during armed conflict. These principles are codified in international humanitarian law, and their breach is illegal [(see also LU17)](/lu-17/). In such cases, there are legal grounds to argue that the use of certain weapons should be prohibited. This has helped NGOs strengthen their arguments by connecting the problems of landmines and cluster munitions with existing legal norms.

So, what is international humanitarian law (also referred to as the law of armed conflict, law of war, or IHL)? This set of rules regulates the conduct of military operations. It tries to balance military requirements with humanitarian values and prohibits violence that has no military purpose – causing unnecessary suffering to soldiers, harming civilians (who do not participate in hostilities), wounded and sick soldiers, and prisoners of war (who no longer fight). Given that IHL imposes certain limitations on the use of arms, these rules are sometimes considered a subset of arms control.[^6] There are both general and specific rules on weapons.

General IHL principles, in particular, Article 51 of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions (AP-I), apply to the use of all weapons. Article 51 prohibits indiscriminate attacks, which

<Quote  fullDocument="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/api-1977/article-51" cite='Article 51 of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions (AP-I)'>
  are not directed at a specific military objective;[…] which employ a method or means of combat which cannot be directed at a specific military objective; or […] are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction
</Quote>
It also defines as indiscriminate and prohibits

  an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated
</Quote>
Articles 35 specifically prohibits the use of weapons
<Quote  fullDocument="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/api-1977/article-35" cite='Article 35 of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions (AP-I)'>
  of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering
</Quote>

According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, the above principles reflect customary international law and are thus binding on all states irrespective of whether they have ratified the AP-I.[^7]
Article 36 of API requires states parties that develop or acquire a new weapon to determine whether its use would be prohibited by the AP-I or other IHL rules. In other words, states need to act before developing weapons to ensure that all new weapons comply with IHL.
While general IHL principles apply to all weapons, they do not directly ban specific weapons.
Whether the use of a weapon is prohibited is assessed on a case-by-case basis and interpretation of the principles often differ, especially regarding what constitutes unnecessary suffering, superfluous injury, or disproportionate harm to civilians. Weapons prohibitions can be considered a way of giving meaning to the principles in practice and of reflecting a convergence of state opinion (but no unanimity) on whether weapons in their normal use would have indiscriminate effects or cause unnecessary suffering. Specific treaty provisions (e.g. banning the use of, stockpiling or transferring a weapon) remain legally binding only on those states that have ratified the respective treaty.
Thus treaties prohibiting or restricting weapons both draw on and, over time, can clarify and develop IHL. This dynamic is at play in several treaties instituting weapons restrictions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (summarised in Chapter 2). However, the use of the principles banning indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks on civilians in order to prohibit specific weapons became particularly prominent following the end of the Cold War.


## Humanitarian arms control vs traditional arms control

    Thus, anti-personnel landmines were prohibited in 1997 because in the aftermath of conflicts, they were taking a heavy toll on civilians in many places, including Cambodia, Afghanistan, Colombia, Mozambique and Angola.

    They killed and maimed innocent people and prevented socio-economic reconstruction. Whatever their military utility during conflict, civilians paid for it with their limbs and lives after the end of fighting.

    Cluster munitions had a similar post-conflict humanitarian impact, as they comprise small bomblets many of which do not explode as intended and thus function as de facto landmines. In addition, because they cover a large territory when fired by artillery or dropped by airplanes anywhere near populated areas, they often indiscriminately affect civilians at the time of their use.

    The campaigns for the prohibition of landmines and cluster munitions were led by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in partnership with  small and medium-sized states. They mobilised the states from the Global South that had predominantly borne the burden of these weapons, while the major military powers, the US, Russia and China, opposed the treaties. The treaties included total prohibitions of the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of the weapons as defined. They also included provisions that aimed to commit states to clear landmines and unexploded cluster munitions and provide victim assistance. In so doing, they comprehensively addressed the problems of these weapons. The treaties do not include verification measures (apart from annual state reports on treaty implementation). Instead, NGOs have taken on a monitoring role and issue annual reports on state policies and practices. Thus, state compliance depends to a large extent on the ability of NGOs to publicly name and shame transgressors. Last, but certainly not least, the treaties set new norms and stigmatise the weapons with the ultimate objective of exerting normative pressure on states that have not signed them.

The background consists of dry grass or barren land, suggesting a hazardous, possibly former conflict zone or military area. The sign serves as a critical alert to prevent people from entering the dangerous mined area."

    The main differences between humanitarian arms control and traditional arms control regarding WMD during the Cold War can be expressed as follows:

      caption="Comparing humanitarian arms control and Cold War amrs control"
      alt="The table compares humanitarian arms control with Cold War arms control, highlighting their different priorities, actors, decision-making processes, and approaches to weapon prohibition and compliance. Focus: Humanitarian arms control prioritizes human security and civilian protection, while Cold War arms control is centered on state security and strategic balance. Main Actors: Humanitarian efforts involve NGOs and smaller states, whereas Cold War arms control was led by superpowers and states. Decision-Making: Humanitarian control allows majority voting, making it more flexible, whereas Cold War treaties required consensus, often leading to slower decision-making. Weapons Prohibition: Humanitarian efforts aim for comprehensive bans, including landmines and cluster munitions, whereas Cold War treaties selectively prohibited chemical and biological weapons but not nuclear weapons. Compliance Mechanisms: Humanitarian arms control relies on NGO monitoring and verification systems, while Cold War agreements used state-led verification for nuclear and chemical weapons. Victim Assistance & Remedial Measures: Humanitarian arms control includes direct support for victims and remedial measures, while Cold War arms control did not prioritize these aspects. The comparison emphasizes a shift from state-centric security to a human-centered approach, with humanitarian arms control being more inclusive, responsive, and victim-focused than its Cold War counterpart."
