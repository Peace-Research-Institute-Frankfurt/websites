## The SALT Process

The launch of the SALT (Strategic Arms Limitation Talks) process between the United States and the USSR at the end of the 1960s indicates a shift in American and Soviet strategic thinking, with the questioning of the notion of strategic superiority.

In this video, you will learn about:

- the process of **bilateral talks** beginning in November 1969
- the spirit and main provisions of the **ABM Treaty**
- the launch of the **SALT II** process

#### SALT and the ABM Treaty: A Timeline

The Cold War era faced different agreements between the US and the USSR – perhaps most remarkably the ABM Treaty, which lasted for thirty years! Discover the history from the first ABM negotiations in 1969 until its termination in 2002.

<Timeline>
    <Event date="November 1969" title="Starting Negotiations">
        
        After the US had proposed to the USSR to launch negotiations on the prohibition of ballistic missile defences in 1966, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) between the US and the USSR started in 1969 (Helsinki, Finland). Part of this first SALT process were formal negotiations of an ABM Treaty.

        The circumstances affecting U.S. national security have changed fundamentally since the signing of the ABM Treaty in 1972. The attacks against the U.S. homeland on September 11 vividly demonstrate that the threats we face today are far different from those of the Cold War. (....) Under the terms of the ABM Treaty, the United States is prohibited from defending its homeland against ballistic missile attack. (....) Given the emergence of these new threats to our national security and the imperative of defending against them, the United States is today providing formal notification of its withdrawal from the ABM Treaty.

## Biological and Chemical Weapons Prohibition

The inadequacies and gaps in the **Geneva Protocol** of 17 June 1925 and the desire to prohibit not only the use, but also the manufacture and stockpiling of bacteriological and chemical weapons led the United Nations General Assembly and the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to take up this issue in the late 1960s. A **Biological Weapons Convention** was negotiated and concluded by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and adopted by the UN General Assembly in December **1971**.

The text was eventually limited to biological weapons, partly because an agreement on the international control of a ban on chemical weapons could not be reached at the time, and partly because the issue of biological weapons was considered less strategic at the time, as the use of biological weapons was less relevant at the tactical level.

In any case, the adoption of this prohibition convention, which paved the way for future negotiations on the **prohibition of chemical weapons** (which were concluded in the **early 1990s**), was another success for multilateral arms control, three years after the opening for signature of the **NPT** (1968).

## The Arms Control Process and Multilateralism at the End of the Cold War

In this video you will learn about:

- the process of multilateralisation of the negotiation of the **Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons** (NPT) in the 1960s
- the progress of discussions on other **universal strategic arms control instruments** (such as the cessation of nuclear tests)
- the reopening of multilateral discussions on the **prohibition of chemical and biological weapons**
- the place of the **Conference on Disarmament** in the arms control machinery (for further information on the UN Disarmament Machinery, see also [LU 18](#18))
