A quick video introduction from the home office, as our planned video production was not possible due to Covid-19.

<LectureVideo smil="lu20/lu20_vl0_author.smil" provider="video-stream">

Hello, my name is Benjamin Hautecouverture and I'm a senior research fellow at the Fondation pour la recherche stratégique (FRS) in Paris. I'm also technical director at Expertise France for the European Union's Outreach Programme on the Arms Trade Treaty and I am a senior fellow at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute in Ottawa.

I have been focusing my research on the study of strategic relations between states, nuclear deterrence, non-proliferation and disarmament in the field of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons, the nuclear proliferation phenomenon and nuclear proliferation crisis and the North-East-Asian strategic landscape with a focus on North Korean nuclear and ballistic issues for more than twenty years. I also work on nuclear security, the chemical weapons prohibition regime and the European Union's security and defence challenges and prospects, including the various EU security strategies.

This learning unit builds on this experience as to help you think in problematic terms about a history of a discipline – arms control – whose definition is dense, evolving and sometimes equivocal. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I will provide the multimedia parts of the learning unit in audio format only. I really hope that you will enjoy and that you will gain an understanding of international arms control history.
