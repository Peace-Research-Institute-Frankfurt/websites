## Peace Dividends: The Gilded Decade (1988–1997)

This video discusses:

- the process that led, during the 1980s, to the signing and entry into force of the **INF Treaty** between the United States and the USSR
- the succession of **initiatives** which strengthened the nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime during the 1990s
- progress on other WMD and conventional arms control issues, including the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction (also known as the **Chemical Weapons Convention**) which was opened for signature in 1993 and entered into force in 1997

## New Challenges

At the end of the last century, the non-proliferation norm began to show signs of fragility. In addition, a number of new types of threats to security emerged. What they had in common was that they involved the proliferation of components of unconventional weapons systems with the potential to cause large-scale damage.

This video debates:

- the **cracking of the world security** order at the turn of the century
- a typology of of **new types of threats** to international security
- the generalization of the concept of **“counter-proliferation”**

## The Dark Decades

The approach to reducing the volume of violence in international affairs through legally binding instruments has not been favoured by major states for many years. The beginning of the erosion of this edifice can be dated to George W. Bush’s first term in office.

In this video, you will learn about:

- the deterioration of the bilateral American-Russian strategic dialogue despite the Obama administration’s attempt to “reset” it
- the factors and terms of the challenge to strategic stability
- the relative stalemate in nuclear disarmament efforts despite the implementation of the **New Start Treaty**
