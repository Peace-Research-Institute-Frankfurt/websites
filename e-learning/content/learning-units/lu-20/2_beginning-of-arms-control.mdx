## Arms Control in Ancient Times: Not Much of an Issue

Arms control practice during the Ancient World was relatively limited for several reasons.

**Firstly**, warfare, which was important to the cultures of many of the peoples of the ancient world, was extremely common across the world – be it in the Middle East, ancient Greece, the Roman world or pre-Han China.

**Secondly**, despite its highly violent nature, warfare was largely fought with unsophisticated concussion or simple cutting weaponry, which made controlling weaponry difficult.

### Early Exceptions of Arms Control

<Details summary="regulating warfare">

In the 4th century BC in ancient Greece the **Great Amphityonic League** established one of the first recorded attempts in arms control in the Ancient World: a set of rules for waging war. The League, an ancient religious association of Greek tribes exercised a political influence through its membership oath, which laid out a doctrine forbidding the destruction of member cities or the cutting off of water supplies – even in wartime.

<Details summary="buffer zones">

Many initiatives predominantly featured the establishment of buffer regions or the disarmament of defeated Empires. In terms of establishing buffer regions, key initiatives included the establishment of a buffer between the Egyptian Rameses II and the Hittite Hattusilis III around 1280BC, or the agreement to manage the buffer state of Armenia between the Roman and Parthian Empires in 58 – 63 AC.

</Details>

<Details summary="disarmament agreements">

In terms of disarmament agreements, key initiatives included the Romans’ imposition of ‘unequal treaties’ (also known as foedus inaequum) on both Carthage in 201 BC and then Macdeon in 196 BC. These unequal treaties required the defeated states to accept significant disarmament measures, including the elimination of most of their navies and, in the case of Carthage, the destruction of its war elephants.

<Details summary="controlling arms sales">

During the 900s AD, the King of the Franks, Charlemagne made it illegal – and punishable by forfeiture of property or death – to sell or export swords and chain mail manufactured in the Frankish empire to foreigners.

</Details>

<Details summary="protection of non-combatants">

The end of the Ancient World era saw the Church, for the first time, seek to limit violence against certain classes of people and property in its **989 Peace of God – Synod of Charoux**. The Peace of God ruling sought to protect non-combatants, agrarian and economic facilities, and the property of the church from war.

## Arms Control and Thought of War in Modern Times

This video debates:
- the widespread use of the **destruction of fortifications** as one of the flagship disarmament measures
- the place of **demilitarization** as a means of ensuring strategic stability
- the impact of **industrialization** on the means of warfare and the first international conventions on the use of modern armaments
