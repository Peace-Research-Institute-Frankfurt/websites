## What are Biological Weapons?

The most important question at the beginning of any discussion on biological weapons is what exactly is meant by a biological weapon?
<LectureVideo smil="/lu03/LU03.01_final.smil" provider="video-stream">

  Biological weapons are complex systems that disseminate disease-causing organisms or toxins to harm or kill humans, animals or plants. They can take many different forms, but generally consist of two parts: a weaponised biological agent and a delivery mechanism.

  While almost any pathogenic organism or toxin can be used as a biological weapon, to be useful to the military, biowarfare agents have traditionally been seen to require certain characteristics: They should be dispersible as an aerosol, be economically scalable, remain stable in the air, have a high virulence, and so on. The biological agent of choice will vary depending on the intended effect, be it to kill or incapacitate, contaminate terrain for long periods, trigger a major epidemic or psychological impact.

  Past biological weapon programmes have researched and tested a large number of pathogens that eventually were not weaponised. Biological agents that were validated for biological weapons in past programmes include those that cause anthrax, brucellosis, Q fever, tularaemia, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, glanders, plague, Marburg virus disease and smallpox.

  These are all biological agents found in nature. Biological agents may also be enhanced from their natural state to make them more suitable for use as weapons, as was the case in some of the historical programmes.

  In future, biological agents might be completely unknown.

  DNA synthesis techniques, which synthesize DNA strands from off-the-shelf chemicals and assemble them into genes and microbial genomes may enable the creation of bioengineered agents whose characteristics combine traits from a number of dangerous pathogens, or whose characteristics are entirely novel and possibly more deadly and communicable than those that exist in nature.

 The delivery systems of biological weapons can also take a variety of forms. Past programmes have constructed missiles, cluster bombs and drones to deliver biological agents, as well as sprayers and spray tanks to be fitted to aircraft, cars, trucks and boats.

  There have also been documented efforts to develop delivery devices for assassinations or sabotage operations, including a variety of sprays, brushes and injection systems, as well as means for contaminating food and clothing.

  The varied manifestations of biological weapons and BW programmes can make them especially hard to detect. This problem is compounded by the fact that there are few aspects of a BW programme that are unique to offensive applications and that are readily detectable by outsiders.
  This is unlike nuclear and chemical weapons. Nuclear weapon programmes leave unique signatures during the development, production and testing process that can be detected at long range. Chemical weapon programmes require industrial-scale production facilities and large stockpiles of munitions to pose a significant military threat and these are visible to overhead reconnaissance systems. Of course biological weapons – such as munitions designed to disseminate biological agents – and biological defences – such as syringes filled with vaccine – can be readily distinguished when placed side by side, but the research, development, production and testing activities used to develop these capabilities are similar, if not identical, in many ways.

### Key biological agents validated for biological weapons in past programmes
<DetailsGroup>
  <Details summary="Bacillus anthracis">

    Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_. It was the first disease for which a microbial origin was established — by Robert Koch in 1876.

    Inhalation anthrax, the deadliest form, initially presents with flu-like symptoms such as a sore throat, fever, muscle aches, and malaise. A brief improvement is typically followed by respiratory failure and shock, often accompanied by meningitis.

    _Bacillus anthracis_ is one of the most feared biological warfare agents. It is easily disseminated, can cause high mortality rates, and poses a significant public health threat. Additionally, it may lead to widespread panic and social disruption, necessitating extensive preparedness measures.

  </Details>
  <Details summary="Yersinia pestis">

    Plague, one of the oldest recorded diseases, is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_.

    There are two primary forms: classic bubonic plague and pneumonic plague. The latter, which involves inhalation of the bacterium, has historically been a target in bioweapons programs.

    Pneumonic plague presents with symptoms including malaise, high fever, chills, headache, and muscle pain. This progresses to septicaemic shock, respiratory failure, and often death.

    _Yersinia pestis_ is a strong candidate for biological weapons due to its ease of culture, mass production potential, and aerosolization capabilities.

  </Details>
  <Details summary="Variola major">

    Smallpox, caused by the variola virus, is a highly contagious viral disease that was officially eradicated in 1980.

    It manifests as fever, severe headaches, and a rash of small, solid, raised lesions. These lesions later fill with fluid, becoming inflamed and pus-filled, typically causing extreme pain.

    _Variola major_ is considered a potent biological weapon due to its hardy nature, high infectiousness via airborne transmission, ability to survive explosive delivery, and its capacity to cause a debilitating disease with high mortality.

  </Details>
  <Details summary="Francisella tularensis">

    Tularemia, caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_, primarily affects small mammals.

    In humans, pneumonic tularemia presents with fever, headaches, chills, cough, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. Skin lesions and swollen lymph nodes may also develop, and the disease can be fatal.

    _Francisella tularensis_ is dangerous due to its ability to be aerosolized, causing large-scale tularemia outbreaks in both humans and animals. It is a resilient bacterium, highly infectious, and capable of surviving in various environments, including water, moist soil, hay, straw, and decaying carcasses.

  </Details>
  <Details summary="Brucella">

    _Brucella_ bacteria infect humans primarily through ingestion of contaminated milk or meat or through contact with broken skin.

    Brucellosis, more common in animals like pigs, sheep, cattle, and dogs, causes flu-like symptoms in humans, including fever, headache, chills, and malaise. In some cases, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea develop. Rarely, the infection may affect the heart and nervous system.

    _Brucella_ is regarded mainly as an incapacitant or as an anti-animal weapon intended to disrupt agricultural production.

  </Details>
  <Details summary="Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus">

    In natural settings, the Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus exists in a rodent-mosquito cycle and only sporadically causes human infections. Mutations enabling replication in horses can lead to widespread equine outbreaks, killing thousands of horses and spreading across vast distances.

    In humans, the severity of VEE infections varies significantly. Some strains cause high mortality and permanent neurological damage.

    The virus is highly infectious and grows well in laboratory conditions, but advances in medicine have revealed that it is less controllable than previously believed when it served as a biological agent in the US.

Biological weapons are usually placed in the same category as chemical and nuclear weapons, in other words, weapons of mass destruction. There are, however, some overlaps and things get blurry.

The overlap between biological and chemical weapons is most evident in the realm of toxins and bioactive molecules, as these substances can be derived from both biological organisms and synthetic chemical processes. Toxins such as botulinum and ricin are naturally occurring biological agents that can be weaponized, blurring the line between biological and chemical warfare. However, these agents are covered by the prohibitions contained in both the Biological Weapons Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention. Additionally, advances in biotechnology may enable the synthesis and enhancement of bioactive molecules, which can be used to disrupt physiological functions in a manner similar to some traditional chemical weapons.
