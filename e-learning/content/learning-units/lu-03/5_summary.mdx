This learning unit has provided an overview of several critical aspects of biological weapons. It covered the key biological agents and delivery systems used in these weapons, detailing their mechanisms and potential impacts. The unit examined the biological weapons programmes of Japan, the United States and the Soviet Union over the 20th century, offering historical context and insights into their development and deployment. Additionally, it assessed the bioterrorism threat and various government responses, highlighting the measures taken to counter these dangers. The international legal framework banning biological weapons and the main challenges of biological disarmament and non-proliferation were also explored, emphasising the ongoing efforts to regulate and eliminate these threats. Lastly, the unit addressed scientific research areas with high misuse potential and the impact of emerging technologies on the threat of biological weapons, as well as efforts to promote responsible science to mitigate these risks.
