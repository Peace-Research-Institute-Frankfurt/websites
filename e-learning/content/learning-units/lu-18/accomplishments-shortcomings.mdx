## Accomplishments

The UN Disarmament Machinery plays an important role in the negotiation and adoption of major multilateral arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament treaties.

Civil society plays a fundamental role in the advancement of disarmament goals and in assisting the United Nations Disarmament Machinery achieve its major accomplishments in the field.

- marches
- studies and publications
- conferences
- side events at international conferences

... are only some of the ways in which civil society is able to generate incredible impact often resulting in the adoption of well-informed national policies and ground-breaking international treaties.

## Criticism and Proposed Changes

The Disarmament Machinery has been the subject of considerable criticism, mainly due to the inability of its bodies to produce substantive results in recent years.

<Quote type="document" cite="Sergio Duarte 2013: How to Revitalize Disarmament Efforts, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace" fullDocument="https://carnegieendowment.org/2013/01/09/how-to-revitalize-disarmament-efforts-pub-50394">

[...] The intransigence of many state positions has frustrated all previous attempts to increase the effectiveness of UN disarmament institutions. In fact, **voting patterns at the First Committee clearly demonstrate the permanence of deep divisions on many disarmament issues**, and for most of the past decade **the Disarmament Commission has not even been able to agree on session agendas.** Even when consensus on agenda items exists, conference reports to the General Assembly simply record the disagreement on the disarmament issues under discussion, which does nothing to promote conceptual progress and agreement on substance.

This beleaguered situation **compounds frustration over the persistent lack of substantive negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament.**

</Quote>

In particular, scholars have directed criticism and reform proposals at the machinery's central components:

### First Committee

| Critique                                                                                                         | Proposals                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Many resolutions reiterate known ideas without proposing concrete actions and don't produce behavioural change.  | Attach concrete actions with specific timelines and deadlines to resolutions, limit the number of resolutions                     |
| The committee deals with a sprawling agenda, diverting focus from critical needs of the international community. | Limit speaking time in general debate, make resolutions legally binding if approved by consensus or three quarters of states.[^1] |

### Conference on Disarmament

| Critique                                                                                                                         | Proposals                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The consensus rule allows progress to be easily blocked, leading to a stalemate.                                                 | Reconsider the consensus rule, at least for the adoption of the agenda                                       |
| Political and regional groupings still reflect Cold War era divisions (i.e. some NATO countries are still in the Eastern Group). | Reconsider the composition of regional and political groups, consider enlargement of overall membership.[^3] |

### UN Disarmament Commission

- Its work has been affected by a lack of political will to deal with certain issues at the multilateral level.
- Its reports to the UNGA often focus on the disagreements on disarmament issues rather than on ways to produce conceptual and substantive progress.[^2]


### UN Security Council

Sanctions imposed by Security Council resolutions aren't always effective in curbing nuclear weapons programmes and ambitions, particularly in the case of North Korea.[^4]

### Within the Machinery

- encourage dialogue among main bodies
- convene a SSOD-IV to put a stronger emphasis on nuclear disarmament, reaffirming the SSOD-I’s mandate
