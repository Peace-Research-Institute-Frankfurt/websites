Since its creation, the **United Nations** has been at the forefront of the global effort to **eliminate weapons of mass destruction and to regulate the trade of small arms and light weapons**.

To achieve these goals, the UN has set up what is referred to as the **UN Disarmament Machinery** – a set of multilateral processes, procedures and practices and international bodies whose purpose is to address disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control issues.

The **UN Disarmament Machinery**, as established in the first Special Session on Disarmament (SSOD) convened by the United Nations General Assembly in 1978, is composed of:

- the United Nations General Assembly First Committee – which debates, drafts and adopts disarmament-related resolutions
- the United Nations Disarmament Commission – which deliberates basic disarmament concepts and principles and makes recommendations
- the Conference on Disarmament – which negotiates and adopts multilateral treaties

## Summary II

The work of the UN Disarmament Machinery is supported by other institutions, which contribute to the definition and the achievement of the **Disarmament Agenda** through statements, research, experts’ meetings and events and by monitoring the implementation of major non-proliferation and disarmament treaties.

**These institutions are:**

- the UN Secretary General
- the UN Security Council
- the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research
- the Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters
- the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs and its regional centers
- the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization
- the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
- the International Atomic Energy Agency

While over the years the **United Nations Disarmament Machinery** and its related institutions have been subjected to **growing criticism**, it is undeniable that it has played a **fundamental role** in shaping the arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament agenda and in providing a framework for the adoption of groundbreaking and extraordinarily forward-looking multilateral treaties.
