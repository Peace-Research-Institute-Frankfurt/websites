Hi and welcome to this learning unit. My name is Federica Dall'Arche and I am the nonproliferation and disarmament researcher at Istituto Affari Internazionali.

I am also a consultant to the Italian presidency of the council of ministers. This learning unit is dedicated to the United Nations disarmament machinery. I will be very happy to guide you through it, exploring with you not only the historical steps that led to its creation, but also its structure and role.

I really hope you will enjoy it and thank you for choosing our EUNPDC eLearning courses. Ciao.
