Since its creation, the UN has been at the forefront of the global effort to eliminate weapons of mass destruction and to regulate the trade of small arms and light weapons. To achieve these goals, it established UN Disarmament Machinery, a set of multilateral processes, procedures and international bodies to address disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control issues.

Core instutions of the Disarmament Machinery include:

- the General Assembly First Committee, which debates, drafts and adopts disarmament-related resolutions
- the UN Disarmament Commission, which deliberates basic disarmament concepts and principles and makes recommendations
- the Conference on Disarmament (CD), which negotiates and adopts multilateral treaties

The Disarmament Machinery is supported by a series of institutions which conduct research, convene experts' meetings, and monitor the implementation of non-proliferation and disarmament treaties. It includes:

- The secretary-general of the UN
- The UN Security Council
- The UN Institute for Disarmament Research
- The Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters
- UN Office for Disarmament Affairs and its regional centers
- The Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization
- The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
- The International Atomic Energy Agency

While over the years the UN Disarmament Machinery and its related institutions have been subjected to growing criticism, it is undeniable that it has played a fundamental role in shaping the arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament agenda and in providing a framework for the adoption of groundbreaking and extraordinarily forward-looking multilateral treaties.
