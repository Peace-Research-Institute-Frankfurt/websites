## The Role of Civil Society

Civil society plays a fundamental role in the advancement of **disarmament goals** and in assisting the United Nations Disarmament Machinery achieve its major accomplishments in the field.

- marches
- studies and publications
- conferences
- side events at international conferences

... are only some of the ways in which civil society is able to generate incredible impact often resulting in the adoption of well-informed national policies and ground-breaking international treaties.

## The Role of Civil Society: Example TPNW

The **Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons** (TPNW) is one of the latest examples and results of civil society’s efforts in promoting disarmament.

**Adopted:** 7 July 2017
**Opened for signature:** 20 September 2017
**Entered into force:** 22 January 2021

The treaty is the first **legally binding** international agreement that outlaws nuclear weapons, prohibiting their use, possessing, development, production, testing, stockpiling and transferring, among other things.

The ultimate goal of the TPNW is the total elimination of nuclear weapons.

The treaty was adopted following decades of international advocacy campaigns organized by civil society.

One of the major architects of the Treaty was **The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons** (ICAN), a coalition of non-governmental organizations, which in 2017 was awarded the Nobel Peace Price in recognition of its efforts to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of the potential use of nuclear weapons.

## Civil Society and Disarmament Paper Series

The Office for Disarmament Affairs publishes the series entitled “Civil Society and Disarmament”.

The series is published within the context of the General Assembly resolutions on the United Nations Disarmament Information Programme and the United Nations Study on Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Education.

The publication provides a forum for the views of civil society in order to further an informed debate on topical issues of arms limitation, disarmament and security.

## The United Nations Disarmament Machinery: Some Criticism

The **UN** has historically been the laboratory and factory for the production of arms control and disarmament achievements, over the years.

However, the work of the machinery has been subjected to some **considerable criticism**, mainly due to the inability of its bodies to produce substantive progress for the past several years.

In the following pages you will find some of the **main criticisms** that have been moved to the machinery, as well as some of the **main proposals** to overcome them.

Looking to the smaller animals while gesturing to the big ones he shouts: I've told them it's unbalanced!"

### United Nation General Assembly First Committee

- Many of the adopted resolutions reiterate same ideas and proposals without producing concrete actions nor behavioural change.

- A large number of items in the agenda prevents focus on the real needs of the international community.

[Jorge Morales Pedraza, The Reform of the United Nations Disarmament Machinery](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11115-015-0314-2)

### Conference on Disarmament

- Its consensus rule, originally designed to facilitate agreement among states, has instead provided a convenient cover for those who aim at blocking progress, leading to a stalemate.

- Political and regional groupings have never changed and reflect Cold War era divisions (i.e. some NATO countries are still in the Eastern Group).

[Patricia Lewis, Ramesh Thakur, Arms Control, Disarmament and the United Nations](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/517020?ln=en)

### United Nations Disarmament Commission

- Its work has been affected by a lack of political will to deal with certain issues at the multilateral level.

- Its reports to the UNGA often focus on the disagreements on disarmament issues rather than on ways to produce conceptual and substantive progress.

[Sergio Duarte, How to Revitalize Disarmament Efforts](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2013/01/how-to-revitalize-disarmament-efforts?lang=en)

### United Nations

- Security Council Resolutions

- United Nations sanction regimes resulted from the UN Security Council Resolutions at times have proved to be ineffective in curbing nuclear weapons programmes and ambitions.

[John Hudson, David Francis, Why Did Sanctions Fail Against North Korea?](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/09/why-did-sanctions-fail-against-north-korea/)


## The United Nations Disarmament Machinery: Some Proposals for Change

Over the years, various parties have voiced their opinion and made proposals on how to develop the Disarmament Machinery.

**Within the United Nation General Assembly First Committee**
- attach concrete actions to resolutions
- set specific timetables and deadlines for concrete actions
- limit number of resolutions
- limit speaking time in general debate
- resolutions to become binding if approved by consensus or ¾ of voters (currently UNGA Resolutions are not binding)

**Within the Conference on Disarmament**
- reconsider the composition of regional and political groups
- reconsider consensus rule, at least for the adoption of the agenda
- consider enlargement of the membership

**Within the Machinery**
- encourage dialogue among main bodies
- convene a SSOD-IV to put a stronger emphasis on nuclear disarmament, reaffirming the SSOD-I’s mandate
