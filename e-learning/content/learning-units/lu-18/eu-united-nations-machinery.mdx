## The European Position


<Quote cite="Jean-Claude Juncker, the 12th president of the European Commission">

[...] We do think that multilateralism has to have a chance. It is difficult but the only avenue for the future. We are supporting actively and fully the UN system – the United Nations – because with your work you pave the way to a better future. The United Nations are the cornerstone of multilateralism, the bridge to a better humanity, a better world. The European Union will remain the close partner of the United Nations and of António Guterres.
