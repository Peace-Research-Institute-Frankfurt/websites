## The European Position

<Quote cite="Jean-Claude Juncker, the 12th president of the European Commission">

[...] We do think that multilateralism has to have a chance. It is difficult but the only avenue for the future. We are supporting actively and fully the UN system – the United Nations – because with your work you pave the way to a better future. The United Nations are the cornerstone of multilateralism, the bridge to a better humanity, a better world. The European Union will remain the close partner of the United Nations and of António Guterres.

Jean-Claude Juncker, the 12th president of the European Commission, described the United Nations as 'the cornerstone of multilateralism, the bridge to a better humanity, a better world'. [^1]

In a [statement at the First Committee in October 2019](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/un-new-york/eu-statement-%E2%80%93-united-nations-1st-committee-thematic-discussion-disarmament_en), the EU reiterated its support for the three central elements the Disarmament Machinery: the First Committee, the Conference on Disarmament and the UN Disarmament Commission.

In the same statement, the EU also stressed the importance of continued financial support to the machinery and its various components to ensure its continued work toward international peace and security.

Hi! My name is Eran Nagan from the European External Action Service. I’m the Chair of COARM, the Working Group for Conventional Arms Exports.

### What is the EU’s role in the UN disarmament system?

The EU is working towards a renewed rules-based multilateralism in order to make it fit for the 21st century – a model of multilateralism that serves good governance as well as EU and global interests and values. Cross-border challenges – like Disarmament, non-proliferation – can only be addressed if countries work together. The United Nations system is the framework through which the international community can create greater security and stability for all. The EU is an extremely active player in the multilateral UN system. Together with member states, we operate as one delivering with a single voice. That’s how we make the most out of our political and economic leverage. At the Council Working Party on Non-Proliferation and Arms Exports in Brussels, we prepare EU positions with member states. The EU Permanent Missions to the UN in New York, Geneva, and Vienna, also coordinate on non-proliferation and disarmament matters. This enables the EU to express common decisions at UN meetings, also to engage in negotiations on resolutions and to implement our shared arms control interests in the treaty bodies.

### How can the EU contribute to multilateral arms control?

Now that the international arms control architecture is under severe pressure from geopolitical tensions, the EU will do more than ever to preserve and to strengthen it. We promote the full implementation of arms control treaties and lobby states to fulfil their obligations to prevent the use and spread of certain weapons. Our support to the Mine Ban Treaty and to the
Biological Weapons Convention, guarantees a world without biological weapons and – in the future – also without landmines. We will join forces with our partners to keep arms control regimes fit for purpose in light of new technological developments. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is a successful essential multilateral instrument that has prevented a global nuclear arms race for half a century. The EU supports its faithful implementation by all. Our assistance to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will continue to ensure that the ban on chemical weapons is upheld and that those using chemical weapons are held to account. The prevention of an arms race in outer space has the EU’s special attention. We also support establishing a programme of action to advance responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. And the EU is helping to re-vitalize the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, so that it will again serve as the principal negotiation forum on disarmament. Through the budget for common foreign security policy, the EU supports the UN system’s institutions and their treaty bodies for disarmament, including for instance the OPCW, the International Atomic Energy Agency, CTBTO, UNODA, UNIDIR …

Our support amounts to over 200 million euros since the year 2004. It is part of our commitment to be a long-standing, reliable ally of the UN system, while discussing the changes these institutions need to make to meet modern challenges. This makes the EU-UNbond a truly strategic relationship. Finally, the EU sponsors ten actions of the UN secretarygeneral’s agenda for disarmament. These actions address nuclear, biological, chemical weapons, conventional arms, the participation of young people and women and much more.

In short: The EU promotes the reform of global governance. We are helping to create a multilateral system that makes effective, timely decisions. A system that is more inclusive, where governments, citizens and industries collaborate to build a safer world.
