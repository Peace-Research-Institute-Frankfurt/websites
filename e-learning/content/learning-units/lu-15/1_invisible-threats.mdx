## Nanotechnology: Facts and Figures

A nanometer (nm) is defined as the millionth of a millimeter – which is approximately the size of a glucose molecule. Nanotechnology (or nanotech) deals with creating or manipulating  such very small objects on the atomic or molecular scale. When experts use the term nanotech, they usually refer to systems between 0,1nm  and 100nm.

Nanostructures offer the possibility of creating new materials with enhanced, novel or unique characteristics and capabilities, including even electromechanical objects on a nanoscale.

The ultimate goal is to design nanomaterial by placing individual atoms or molecules at a predesignated space in a structure.

Significant government interest in nanotech started at the advent of the new millennium. From the very beginning, the USA has been at the forefront of the nanotech revolution. In 2000, President Clinton created the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), a federal research and development program. Between 2001 and 2016 the NNI received more than $22 billion from participating agencies, including – amongst others – the Department of Defense, Department of Energy or NASA. Between 2001 and 2012, the DOD’s annual contribution was between 23% and 32%.

Other countries with a strong interest in nanotech includes  member states of the European Union (especially Germany and the UK), Japan, China, Russia and Korea.

While many nanotech applications are civilian, there are many military usages as well.
