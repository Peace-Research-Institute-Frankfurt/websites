## The EU and emerging technologies
Given the diverse nature of the issues covered in this learning unit as well as the different stages of technological development, it is hard to summarise the EU’s activities with regard to emerging technologies. Some of the issues covered in this unit have not yet led to a systematic and comprehensive review by EU institutions.

Others, however, like drones, AI and LAWS, have received more attention over time. After all, the EU is also interested in quantum technology and nanotechnology, but only for peaceful purposes. Military issues or matters related to preventive arms control are not discussed in these areas. However, this is not surprising, since, as described above, there has been no international discourse on any form of regulation in this area to date. And different actors had different perspectives, of course. The European Parliament (EP) started focusing on drones and drone warfare very early. On 27 February 2014, the EP already adopted resolution 2014/2567(RSP) (www) on the use of armed drones, drawing attention to the increase in extraterritorial lethal operations by drones and the resulting civilian death toll, calling *‘drone strikes outside a declared war by a state on the territory of another state without the consent of the latter or of the UN Security Council […] a violation of international law’.*
In contrast, the Commission did not take a position on armed drones or their worldwide use and focused mainly on the civilian use of unmanned systems.
In the LAWS sector, however, the European actors are more in agreement.
Notably, in its 2014 resolution, the EP also called for a ‘ban [on] the development, production and use of fully autonomous weapons which enable strikes to be carried out without human intervention’. In 2018, the EP adopted a resolution on autonomous weapons systems (2018/2752(RSP), stressing, *inter alia*, that

*‘EU policies and actions are guided by the principles of human rights and respect for human dignity, the principles of the UN Charter and international law; whereas these principles should be applied in order to preserve peace, prevent conflicts and strengthen international security’*

and that

*‘human involvement and oversight are central to the lethal decision-making process, since it is humans who remain accountable for decisions concerning life and death.’*

In 2021, the EO adopted another resolution (2020/2013(INI)), this time with a broader perspective on artificial intelligence and international law, which referred to both civilian and military use, but also directly addressed the issue of LAWS and, as in 2018, emphasised ‘the need for an EU-wide strategy against LAWS and a ban on so-called “killer robots”’.
The official representatives of the EU delegation to the United Nations in Geneva did not want to go as far as the EP, but nevertheless emphasised the importance of human controls and the limits set by international law. In 2023, an EU representative and official participant in the GGE negotiations on LAWS stated

*‘that human beings must make decisions with regard to the use of force, exert control over weapons systems that they use and remain accountable for decisions over the use of force in order to ensure compliance with International Law, in particular International Humanitarian Law (IHL), taking into account ethical considerations.’*

Finally, the EU is also interested in quantum technology and nanotechnology, but only for peaceful purposes. Military issues or questions of preventive arms control are not discussed in these areas. However, this is not surprising since no international discourse on any form of regulation has taken place in this area to date.
