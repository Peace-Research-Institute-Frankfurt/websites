## The long history of the uncrewed system

<LectureVideo smil="/lu15/HSFK-PC_LU15-CH02_12b_250109.smil" provider="video-stream">

  Technologies for remotely piloted military vehicles date back as far as World War I. A very early predecessor to today’s remotely piloted aerial vehicles – commonly known as drones – was the British Kettering Bug shown here. It was initially launched without additional guidance, making it somewhat comparable to a cruise missile. Later on, attempts were made to fly the Kettering Bug by radio control, like a drone.

  Back then, these systems were way too imprecise and unreliable to be of any use for defeating enemy targets. In fact, the early 20th century drones ended up as targets for shooting practice. It was not until the Vietnam era that drones eventually became valuable aerial reconnaissance and surveillance assets.

  In recent decades, uncrewed systems have seen increasing military use. Examples include not only unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), but also unmanned systems on and below the surface of the sea, as well as ground-based robots (UGVs).

  The increased availability of uncrewed systems has brought significant changes to warfare, especially when it comes to dirty, dull or dangerous missions. These systems provide increased reconnaissance, surveillance and targeting capabilities, whilst allowing military personnel to stay out of harm’s way. Moreover, unmanned systems can operate in hazardous environments, such as minefields, with the ability to operate around the clock, staying on mission for extended periods and providing real-time data and intelligence.

  Two technologies – GPS and satellite communication uplinks – significantly improved UAV capabilities towards the end of the 20th century, making it possible for them to be piloted with precision and from a great distance.

  The well-known MQ-1 Predator, for instance, was already used for reconnaissance in the Balkan wars of the 1990s.

  Technological developments alone were not what gave rise to ‘drone warfare’, however. The political landscape was key. A major driver was 9/11 and the targeting of specific individuals during the so-called ‘war on terror’.[^2]

  It is worth noting that commercial technology fueled this development – and so, today, we see not only military drones but countless civilian drones in all shapes and sizes, too. Russia’s war against Ukraine is characterised by the use of an unprecedented number of remotely piloted vehicles, including both expensive weapons platforms and attritable one-way systems, many of the latter being repurposed commercial off-the-shelf quadcopters

## The current state of drone proliferation and regulation

When it comes to proliferation, it has become almost impossible to keep track of which country has procured military drones, at least when working with unclassified sources. Many projects that at least tried to keep tabs on the situation, have stopped operating, including the renowned “World of Drones” project, run by the New America Foundation[^3].  Who knows where the next container with Shaheds, Orlans or ZT-180s will end up? We do not know and we will not know, so we should not create the impression that we somehow do. However, it is fair to assume that more than 100 countries have developed and/or procured military drones so far and that around 40 were in possession armed drones in the early 2020s.[^4] Even tracking those countries which used armed drones in combat has become difficult, to say the least. As the following chart shows, up until the mid-2010s, only a handful of countries actively used combat drones, but since then, more and more states have been using these weapons. It is fair to say that drones have become a rather common sight on the battlefields worldwide and that classifying them as an ‘emerging technology’ is a bit of a stretch.

The success of the military drone is partly due to the fact that in the 2000s, when not many countries were using this technology, which at the time was still new, it was not possible to introduce international restrictions let alone a ban on the use of military drones. Only a few arms control or export control regimes mention uncrewed vehicles explicitly. Another reason was the advent of new drone manufacturers such as China and Turkey. To understand the rise of these manufacturers, we have to look at what is (still) the most relevant regime covering military drones – the Missile Technology Control Regime [(MTCR, also see LU12)](/lu-12/).[^6]  The MTCR is, according to its website, ‘an informal political understanding’ among 35, mostly Western states ‘that seek to limit the proliferation of missiles and missile technology’. When the regime was formed in 1987, unmanned aerial vehicles were included as at that time people expected drones to serve as yet another delivery vehicle for weapons of mass destruction, rather than a cheap platform for conventional ammunition. For the USA in particular, however, the MTCR was, for a long time, one of the main hurdles to the export of military drones, which meant that only its closest allies, such as the UK, were allowed to import state-of-the-art drones such as the Predator or Reaper. But this opened opportunities for non-MTCR-member China to sell its drones worldwide while creating dependencies. Turkey, on the other hand, started developing its own drone industry after being unable to import US models, becoming one of the most in-demand drone producers in the world. In 2020, however, the US government decided to reinterpret the MTCR guidelines to allow more US combat drones to fall into the less restrictive category II[^7].

Other regimes worth mentioning in this context are the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), the Wassenaar Arrangement, the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE Treaty) and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty [see LU12](/lu-12/).

## International treaties and regimes relevant for uncrewed systems

<DetailsGroup>
  <Details summary="Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR)">

    [Missile Technology Control Regime](https://www.mtcr.info/en)

    Restricts export of missile and drone technology.

    Founded in 1987. 35 members, not a treaty, but a voluntary informal political understanding among states.

    Distinguishes between two categories:
    - _Category I_ includes rocket and unmanned aerial vehicle systems with a payload of 500 kg and above and a range of at least 300 km. Regardless of export purpose: ‘strong presumption of denial’.
    - _Category II_ includes rocket and unmanned aerial vehicle systems with a payload of below 500 kg and a range of at least 300 km. Subject to strict licensing requirements.

    Since 2020, however, the US has decided to treat UAVs with a maximum speed of less than 800 km/hr as Category II, even if all other characteristics place them in Category I. The aim of this policy change is, among other things, to ‘increase trade opportunities for US companies’,  to ‘strengthen bilateral relationships’ or to ‘bolster partner security and counterterrorism capabilities’.[^8]

  <Details summary="Arms Trade Treaty  (ATT)">

    [Arms Trade Treaty](https://thearmstradetreaty.org/).

    Regulates international trade of certain conventional arms.

    Entered into force in 2014. 113 State Parties, 28 Signatories that are not yet State Parties, 54 states that have not joined.

    Covers eight categories of weapons systems, including battle tanks, armoured combat vehicles, combat aircraft, attack helicopters and warships.


    <Treaty name="att" />

  </Details>
  <Details summary="Wassenaar Arrangement">

    [Wassenaar Arrangement](https://www.wassenaar.org/) Entered into force in 1996. Voluntary arrangement comprising 42 states.

    Aim: ‘to contribute to regional and international security and stability, by promoting transparency and greater responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies, thus preventing destabilising accumulations’.
    ‘Participating States apply export controls to all items set forth in the List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies and the Munitions List, with the objective of preventing unauthorized transfers or re-transfers of those items.” Specific UAVs or relevant technologies are controlled in the Arrangements Dual Use List, Category 9.


    <Institution name="wasse" />

  </Details>
  <Details summary="Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) Treaty">

    Treaty on Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles between the US and USSR (INF Treaty). Entered into Force 1988.

    Eliminated all intermediate-range ballistic missiles with a range between 500 and 5,500 km.

    Ceased to be in force in 2019 after US withdrawal over alleged Russian violations.

    There was a debate on whether long-range UAVs, such as US Raptors, should be covered by the treaty.

    While the Russian position was that they should, the US position – in contrast to the MTCR understanding – made a clear distinction between UAVs and missiles and rejected the Russian interpretation.

## Limitations of remotely controlled systems

<LectureVideo smil="/lu15/HSFK-PC_LU15-CH03_08d_240524.smil" provider="video-stream">
  Despite the military advantages remotely piloted systems offer, these systems require near-constant control and communication links. This renders the vehicle susceptible to discovery or electronic warfare countermeasures. Moreover, latency – that is, the time the control signal needs to travel (sometimes to a satellite in space and back) and get processed – becomes an issue. Depending on the distances involved, this latency can amount to seconds. On top of this is the time the human operator needs to process the information, make a decision and send the respective command back to the vehicle. These additional seconds or minutes can mean the difference between hitting a target or not, winning an engagement or losing the asset.

  Daisy-chained line-of-sight connections allow for control and communication without necessarily revealing a system’s location, while enabling that system to continue a mission even in operational environments where electronic warfare measures are degrading or disrupting communications. But getting rid of the link entirely would provide even stronger protection against communications disruption or hijacking. This is one of the drivers behind making uncrewed systems ‘autonomous’. The main motive, however, is that removing the uplink and the human from the loop eliminates the invariable delay between the human operator’s command and the system’s response, thus generating a clear tactical advantage over any remotely controlled and thus invariably ‘slower’ adversarial system.
