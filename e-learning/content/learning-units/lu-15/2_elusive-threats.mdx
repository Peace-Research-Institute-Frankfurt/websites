## Examples of less lethal weapons

Non Lethal or Less Lethal come in a great variety. The table on the right side gives you an overview over the most important systems. Please click to enlarge.

| Technology                 | Examples                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Kinetic Energy             | Impact munitions (wooden dowels, bean bags, plastic bullets, water cannons, ring airfoil projectile, foam rubber projectiles )                                  |
| Barriers and entanglements | Devices to slow the progress and stop vehicles or boats (nets, chains, spikes, rigid foams)                                                                     |
| Electrical                 | e.g. Taser stun guns, retractable stun sword, exoskeleton stun weapon, wireless electrical weapon (e.g Close Quarters Shock Rifle), laser-induced plasma weapon |
| Acoustic                   | Acoustic generators, acoustic cannon, long-range acoustic devices                                                                                               |
| Directed energy            | High-power microwave, milimitre wave, lasers, pulsed energy, projectile weapon                                                                                  |
