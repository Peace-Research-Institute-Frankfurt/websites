## Drawbacks of remotely Controlled Systems: Communication and Latency
Despite the military advantages remotely piloted systems offer, these systems require near-constant control and communication links. This renders the vehicle susceptible to discovery or electronic warfare countermeasures. Moreover, latency – that is, the time the control signal needs to travel (sometimes to a satellite in space and back) and get processed – becomes an issue. Depending on the distances involved, this latency can amount to seconds. On top of this is the time the human operator needs to process the information, make a decision and send the respective command back to the vehicle. These additional seconds or minutes can mean the difference between hitting a target or not, winning an engagement or losing the asset.

[A figure is missing here!]

Daisy-chained line-of-sight connections allow for control and communication without necessarily revealing a system’s location, while enabling that system to continue a mission even in operational environments where electronic warfare measures are degrading or disrupting communications. But getting rid of the link entirely would provide even stronger protection against communications disruption or hijacking. This is one of the drivers behind making uncrewed systems ‘autonomous’. The main motive, however, is that removing the uplink and the human from the loop eliminates the invariable delay between the human operator’s command and the system’s response, thus generating a clear tactical advantage over any remotely controlled and thus invariably ‘slower’ adversarial system.
