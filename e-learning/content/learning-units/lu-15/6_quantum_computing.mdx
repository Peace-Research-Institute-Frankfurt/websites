Quantum computers take the principle of miniaturisation which classical computers have followed down to the single atom on the next lowest level by utilising the fundamentally different physical principles that apply on the sub-atomic level for computer operations.

Superposition is the first such phenomenon used for this purpose. It involves superposing different states. Quantum computers use superposition in quantum bits (qubits), which, unlike classical bits with their two discrete states (1 or 0), can take on all states between 1 and 0 at the same time. Quantum computers thus offer massive parallel computing performance compared with classical computers. They are also better at scaling – at least in theory – because ideally every additional qubit doubles the computer's performance, which thus grows exponentially. With computing tasks of exponentially increasing complexity, quantum computers develop solutions quickly (in seconds or minutes) where even the biggest classical supercomputers would need too much time (tens of thousands of years). This is what is commonly understood by the term 'quantum supremacy'.

The second phenomenon utilised in quantum computing is entanglement. Entanglement means that two or more particles are linked with each other, i.e. they can represent the same state, even over long distances. The numerous possibilities for flexibly manipulating such entangled qubits contribute to the speed with which a quantum computer is able to handle complex computing problems.

There are still a number of difficult hurdles to overcome before quantum computing can be used on a widespread basis (by miniaturising mass-producible architectures). Sceptics note that quantum computers could face the same fate as atomic fusion. Decade after decade, it has been predicted that this technology will finally have its breakthrough. But this breakthrough never seems to materialise.

However, if quantum computers were to one day make their way out of the lab and into everyday applications, the implications would be extremely wide-ranging. From a military perspective, the most important elements to focus on would be quantum cryptography and quantum sensing.


## *Quantum cryptography*

When it comes to cryptography, established cryptographic methods take advantage of the fact that certain mathematical problems cannot be solved in a reasonable time frame by classical computers. As outlined above, quantum computers have the potential to introduce a paradigm shift in this respect by very quickly decrypting databases that, by current standards, have been securely encrypted. Stored datasets that so far have been impossible to decipher could also suddenly be accessed.

At the moment, this is just a theoretical scenario. Nevertheless, ideas for quantum computer-resistant encryption methods for the world of classical computers and the internet are already being discussed. In 2016, for example, the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) in the US already initiated a process to develop and standardise such methods and make them more readily available. The first results for such quantum computer-resistant encryptions are currently under review.

In light of the progress that has been made in just under three decades, the prototypes and special applications that already exist, the investments already made and, last but not least, all the talent and time that has been devoted to the field worldwide, when it comes to a quantum computing breakthrough, it is more likely a question of 'when' rather than 'if'.

## *Quantum sensing*

Sensor technology is the area of quantum technology with the highest number of concrete applications that are already in use. Unlike quantum computers, quantum sensors do not require large numbers of entangled pairs of particles. Considerable advances over the last two decades when it comes to the production and manipulation of the quantum states of particles also mean that research now has a better handle on 'noise', which of course affects the precision of measurements. Much like in the field of computers, a variety of different physical principles and designs are also being explored simultaneously.
With quantum sensors, mass, time, place, speed, acceleration and electromagnetic field strength can be measured several orders of magnitude more accurately than with classical sensors. Spatial resolutions in the nanometre range are possible. Quantum clocks make it possible to synchronise processes precisely. Quantum gyroscopes for inertial navigation systems and quantum sensors for measuring earth's magnetic field can make autonomous mobility possible without having to rely on GPS or other satellite navigation systems. Compact quantum magnetometers that work at room temperature are currently being developed. These could be used in areas ranging from submarine detection to brain–computer interfaces.
