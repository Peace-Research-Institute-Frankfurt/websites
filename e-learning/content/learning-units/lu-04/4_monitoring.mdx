## Introduction


### What is monitoring?
Monitoring is the act of observing and checking the progress, quality and state of something over time — in other words, maintaining regular surveillance over something.

### What type of monitoring?
The activity of interest for monitoring depends on the type of treaty or agreement in place. In the context of nuclear non-proliferation, examples are treaties and agreements that guarantee the peaceful use of nuclear energy, ban nuclear tests, control the proliferation of nuclear weapons or nuclear disarmament. For instance, if there is a nuclear test ban treaty in place, the activity of interest to be monitored would be the execution of a nuclear explosion. Under the NPT, fuel cycle activities that can indicate the use of nuclear material for non-peaceful purposes are of interest, including the construction of facilities that are not declared or the modification of the current facilities.

The nuclear fuel cycle activities that are most relevant for monitoring in the context of non-proliferation are those related to the paths to acquire material that could be used in a nuclear weapon.<br/>
The two nuclear materials that could be used in a nuclear weapon discussed in Chapter 3 were uranium, enriched to above 90% in the isotope 235, and plutonium. Considering that the main process to acquire enriched uranium is the enrichment process, and that to acquire plutonium, uranium needs to be fed into a nuclear reactor and later separated in a reprocessing facility, here, we will discuss the monitoring of the enrichment, reprocessing and the operation of the nuclear reactor itself.

## How to monitor

<LectureVideo smil="/lu04/HSFK-PC_LU04-CH06-rewrk05_15c_250326.smil" provider="video-stream">
  The type of monitoring method chosen is highly dependent on the purpose of the monitoring. Some well-established methods are satellite imagery, environmental sampling and analysis, infrasound, hydroacoustic, seismic signals and other nuclear safeguards procedures.

  **Satellite imagery:** Visible light imagery can monitor facility construction and demolition activities at known sites, as well as the operation of nuclear reactors equipped with vapor-emitting cooling towers.[^1] Satellites capable of thermal infrared imagery can also be used to detect water flowing from nuclear reactors into rivers or the ocean.[^2] Satellite technology cannot, however, unambiguously identify uranium enrichment when it is performed by gas centrifuges or reprocessing activities.


  **Infrasound:** Acoustic waves with very low frequency are called infrasound. Explosions in the atmosphere and underground can generate infrasound waves, and these waves are able to travel long distances with low dissipation. Infrasound waves can come from many sources, such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, aircraft and large chemical explosions. Since the sound propagates efficiently, it can be detected at large distances from its origin.

  **Hydroacoustic:** To monitor hydroacoustic waves means recording signals that show changes in water pressure generated by sound waves in the water. Hydroacoustic monitoring is used to localise and differentiate between signals generated by nuclear explosions and signals from other sources.

  **Seismic signals:** Seismic signals are waves transmitted through the Earth, and can have many different sources. Seismic signals can be used to detect underground nuclear explosions. Seismic technology is very efficient, since seismic waves can travel very fast and long distances. Seismometers, usually arranged as an array, detect seismic waves amplifying the seismic signal against the seismic background. In so doing they provide information on the location, depth and magnitude of an event.

  **Environmental sampling:** To sample means to collect a small part of air, water, solid or biota from the ambient environment. The sample is analysed for indicators, such as traces of chemical components, specific elements or radiation. There are many techniques for the detection and analysis of radioactive particles and noble gases. Examples of these techniques include gamma spectroscopy, detection of gamma-beta coincidences, and mass spectroscopy.[^3] In the monitoring of nuclear explosions, for instance, samples of aerosol particles collected on air filters are tested for the presence of radionuclides via gamma spectroscopy. In addition to this, radioactive noble gasses are also collected and the relative abundance of different noble gas isotopes is measured.

  **Other nuclear safeguards procedures:** The objective of the international nuclear safeguards system created by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is to deter the spread of nuclear weapons. Developed to ensure that the states under the NPT are honouring their legal obligations, the IAEA safeguards enable the performance of independent verification that nuclear facilities and materials are not misused and are not diverted from peaceful uses. Among the technical measures used by the IAEA, different systems for monitoring nuclear facilities and material include satellite images, the collection of environmental samples and remote monitoring. For example, unattended monitoring systems (UMSs) run 24 hours a day, 365 days a year without requiring the presence of an inspector in the field.

## Monitoring of nuclear test explosions and subcritical tests

### Nuclear explosions

The monitoring of a nuclear explosion would be part of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban  Treaty (CTBT), adopted in 1996, once it enters into force. The four sensor technologies that are part of the CTBT verification regime are seismic, infrasound, hydroacoustic and radionuclide detection. Examples of CTBT monitoring stations can be seen here.

The different International Monitoring Stations are set up in such a way that signals from several of the monitoring techniques must be detected at the same time to indicate a test explosion.<br/>
Radionuclide detection is the only technique that can confirm whether an explosion detected and located by the other three techniques is indicative of a nuclear test. The Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT), adopted in 1963, was the first treaty to use environmental sampling for verification purposes. The radionuclide stations detect both radioactive particles that are collected on filters, and radioactive noble gases collected from the atmosphere. In total there are 337 IMS facilities around the globe:

### Subcritical tests instead of explosions

A subcritical nuclear weapons test uses quantities of fissile material that are lower than the subcritical mass, so there is no self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. The fissile material used is generally plutonium-239. Subcritical tests release less than one ton of TNT equivalent and are more difficult to detect, especially if performed underground. Nowadays, there is no regime for the international observation of subcritical tests. Researchers are investigating how to perform monitoring and verification of such tests and are also exploring measures to ensure transparency related to subcritical tests under the CTBT.[^4]


## Monitoring of enrichment and reprocessing activities

The detection of clandestine weapons-grade uranium production and plutonium production and separation is one of the main goals in verifying the compliance of non-nuclear weapon states with the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the compliance of nuclear weapon states with future fissile material cutoff treaties, such as the Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty (FMCT).

States under the NPT are subject to international nuclear safeguards inspections and monitoring by the IAEA.


The Global Fissile Material Report from 2007 shows the detectability of different steps of the enrichment and plutonium production processes by satellite imaging and environmental sampling.[^5]

According to the report, the production of weapon-usable fissile materials, such as plutonium and highly enriched uranium (HEU), varies significantly in how easily it can be detected by remote monitoring methods. Some technologies, like nuclear reactors and gaseous diffusion facilities, are generally more visible through satellite imagery and thermal detection. Others, such as reprocessing plants, conversion facilities, and especially centrifuge enrichment, are far more difficult to identify without direct access. Environmental sampling can help in some cases, but its effectiveness is often limited to large-scale operations. These differences highlight the challenges in reliably detecting and monitoring nuclear proliferation activities from a distance.

### Plutonium production and separation

To be used in a weapon, plutonium needs to be generated inside a nuclear reactor and then separated from the spent nuclear fuel.

Undeclared nuclear reactors that are readily detected via satellite images, open source information or nuclear safeguards inspection. Changes in the reactor operation to produce plutonium is more challenging to monitor but can be identified if the facility in question is subject to nuclear safeguards.

New undeclared reprocessing facilities, operating on a large scale with the aim of being profitable, can be detected via satellite image, open data assessment, etc. The two most challenging scenarios when it comes to detecting an undeclared reprocessing facility are if a common industrial facility is remodelled to function as a quick and simple reprocessing plant, or if a declared reprocessing facility is used to divert material to produce plutonium. In the first case, the monitoring of material in the undeclared facility could indicate illegal activity. In the second case, on-site monitoring could be used to detect such an attempt.


A reprocessing plant has many characteristic features that could be identified during a managed-access inspection, visually and/or with appropriate instruments, without revealing sensitive information.[^6] These include:
 - heavy walls for gamma radiation shielding, typically 1–2 metres thick and made of metal aggregate containing concrete. Ultrasonic gauges calibrated for wall thickness of up to 1.3 metres are commercially available;
 - very high gamma-ray radiation levels inside spaces where spent fuel has been dissolved and fission products separated from the Pu. A simple dosimeter that measures only gamma-ray dose and not its energy spectrum could verify the radiation levels;
 - release of volatile radionuclides during the dissolution of spent fuel. The fission product detected furthest downwind from a reprocessing plant is Kr-85. This product is produced in 0.3% of fissions of U-235, has a half-life of 11 years and is not reactive, thus remaining in the atmosphere. Unless it is removed and contained inside the facility, it should be possible to detect Kr-85 outside the site fence of an operating reprocessing facility.

### Highly enriched uranium production

Enrichment via gaseous diffusion requires large-scale facilities that usually have a specific shape and use a lot of energy, allowing detection via both visible and thermal satellite imaging. Enrichment via centrifuges cannot be detected via the satellite imaging or environmental sampling techniques considered in the GFM report. Monitoring systems that are placed inside the facility might be required.
Nuclear safeguards procedures are applied in enrichment facilities declared under the NPT to ensure that the uranium enrichment level is kept under the allowed limit, which usually means low-enriched uranium (LEU) used as fuel in nuclear power reactors. Gamma-ray spectroscopy and weighting are examples of techniques used by nuclear safeguards to monitor fuel enrichment.
In the case of the FMCT, where states agreed to stop the production of HEU, facilities that were used to produce military HEU were converted to produce civil LEU. The challenge in such facilities is to distinguish HEU particles that were produced in the past from present production particles. For this purpose, techniques to identify the isotopic signature and the age of such particles are applied.
