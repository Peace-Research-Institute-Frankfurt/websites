Since their origins during World War II, with the evolution of technology, nuclear weapons have become more precise, reliable, destructive and smaller.

Although nuclear weapons testing has historically been a key aspect of developing and validating new weapon designs, subcritical tests and computer simulations have largely replaced live tests, allowing for the continued refinement of nuclear arsenals without actual detonations. Even though the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) has not yet fully entered into force, it has led to a de facto moratorium on nuclear testing by major powers.

The primary materials used in nuclear weapons are plutonium-239 and highly enriched uranium (HEU). The production of these materials involves complex processes, including uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing. Beyond the control and monitoring of nuclear weapons, the control and monitoring of nuclear materials and activities is essential for arms control and non-proliferation. International frameworks like the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and organisations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and EURATOM play crucial roles in verification and compliance.

Currently, there are five recognised nuclear weapon states – the United States, Russia, France, the United Kingdom and China – and four other states with nuclear weapon capabilities – India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea. Although the real numbers of nuclear weapons are considered national secrets by the states, the global military stockpile is estimated to be higher than 12,000 nuclear warheads. Nuclear disarmament seems to be out of reach, as states are still investing a lot of money in maintaining and modernising their nuclear arsenals.

While the near future of nuclear weapons technology will likely focus on further advancements in delivery systems, advances in technology promise enhanced monitoring and verification capabilities for treaties and agreements on nuclear weapons control and disarmament in the more distant future.
