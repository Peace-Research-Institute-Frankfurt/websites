## Summary
- International non-proliferation and disarmament law **forms part of international law**.
- It is also one of international law’s many **sub-regimes**.
- The **founding and functioning principles** of non-proliferation and disarmament law are therefore aligned with those of international law.
- The **sources** (e.g. treaty law, customary law), **participants** (e.g. states, international organisations), **application and enforcement** (e.g. legal disputes regarding non-compliance) of international law apply in the same way to international non-proliferation and disarmament law.
- International non-proliferation and disarmament law is **related to other areas/sub-regimes of international law.**
- **Treaty law** applies to all non-proliferation and disarmament treaties.
- The **law on the use of force** can intersect with international non-proliferation and disarmament law.
- Use of CBRN weapons can amount to a violation of **international humanitarian law** and amount to war crimes under **international criminal law.**
- **International human rights law** will always apply, for example with regard to the fair trial rights of an alleged perpetrator of an offence related to CBRN weapons.
- **National implementation** of international non-proliferation and disarmament law is needed in order to carry out international obligations at the national level.
- Regardless of a state’s relationship with international law (i.e. whether it is more monist or dualist), **national legislation** is often required in different areas of national law to be able to give practical effect to a state’s international legal commitments on non-proliferation and disarmament.
- **National enforcement** of both international and national non-proliferation and disarmament law involves structures and procedures such as the establishment of **national authorities, national inspections, national investigations by police and court cases.**
- The **EU** has its **own legal order** within international law, and as such has developed relevant **treaties, regulations and decisions** that together form EU law on non-proliferation and disarmament.
