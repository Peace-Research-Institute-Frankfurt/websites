## International Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Law as Part of International Law

### What is international law?

International law is the body of norms governing the relations between its subjects. This includes states, first and foremost, but also others, such as international organisations.

International law regulates different fields of cooperation ranging from terrorism, outer space and global communications to human rights, the environment and non-proliferation and disarmament.

### How are international law and non-proliferation and disarmament law related?

International non-proliferation and disarmament law forms part of international law and is one of its many “sub-regimes”. The founding and functioning principles of non-proliferation and disarmament law are therefore aligned with those of international law.

This holds true with regard to:

- the sources of international non-proliferation and disarmament law
- its subjects
- its application

### Does international law, and international non-proliferation and disarmament law, really work?

The flaws of international law often show in dramatic and difficult situations such as wars and severe political and social upheaval. These shortcomings receive much attention in the media, causing public opinion to question the usefulness, or sometimes even existence, of international law.

However, as noted by renowned scholar Louis Henkin,

<Quote type="Document">
  almost all nations observe almost all principles of international law and almost all of their obligations almost all of the time.[^1]
</Quote>

As the “100 Ways” project described in the next section demonstrates, almost all of the time we may just not be aware of it.

Moreover, even at such challenging times as armed or political conflict, states consistently seek to justify their acts on the basis of international law. This demonstrates that states consider themselves bound by the rules they have set, whatever the circumstances.
During certain periods of time or certain events, states may deny and defy international law, but this will almost always come at a political or economic cost in their relations with other states.

The [“100 Ways” project](https://www.asil.org/resources/100Ways) of the American Society of International Law shows that international law is so deeply and comprehensively ingrained into everyday life that its existence can be easily overlooked. The project gives a 100 examples of how international law works across eight areas: daily life, leisure, travel, commerce, health and the environment, personal liberty, safety and development, and peace and security.
To give one such example, mailing a postcard to any country across the globe is easy, because of the 1964 Constitution of the Universal Postal Union, which sets up a worldwide postal network and ensures that the stamp you bought is recognised for mail delivery by all other states.

As for peace and security, another example is “banning cruel and inhumane weapons such as sarin gas”[^2]. This is done by a number of treaties including the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention and the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. These treaties form part of international non-proliferation and disarmament law.

### Legally Binding and Non-Binding Instruments

<FlipCards>
<Card front="Binding or “hard law”: creates obligations and rights">

- treaties (e.g. Chemical Weapons Convention)
- custom (e.g. prohibition of use of biological weapons)
- general principles (e.g. good faith)
- judicial decisions and teaching of the most qualified publicists (e.g. International Court of Justice cases)

</Card>

<Card front="Non-binding or “soft law”: gives guidance and recommendations and may be incorporated into legally binding instruments">

- UN General Assembly resolutions (e.g. [Resolution 74/66](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3846746): strengthening and developing the system of arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and agreements[^1])
- codes of conduct, guidelines (e.g. [IAEA Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources](https://www.iaea.org/publications/6956/code-of-conduct-on-the-safety-and-security-of-radioactive-sources))

### Legally Binding Sources

#### Examples of Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Treaties

The following treaties aim to prohibit so-called ‘weapons of mass destruction:’ biological, chemical, nuclear and radiological weapons. They also aim to control the materials that may be diverted from peaceful activities in science, medicine and industry to make such weapons. They are legally binding on states that have joined them: they create rights and obligations for those states.

<Details summary="Biological weapons and materials">
- 1925 Protocol for the Prohibition of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare
- 1972 Convention on the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons and on their destruction (BWC)

#### Focus on the Chemical Weapons Convention

The <Term t="CWC">Chemical Weapons Convention</Term> is an interesting example of a legally binding source of non-proliferation and disarmament law. It prohibits an entire category of weapons. While toxic chemicals can be misused to develop these weapons, states have the right to undertake peaceful activities with these chemicals; including for industrial, agricultural, research, medical and pharmaceutical purposes. Moreover, the CWC establishes an international organisation tasked with verifying that chemical weapons have been destroyed and that states’ activities with toxic chemicals remain lawful.

You can read more about the CWC’s history in [learning unit 02 on chemical weapons](https://nonproliferation-elearning.eu/learningunits/chemical-weapons/).

In comparison, the <Term t="BWC">Biological Weapons Convention</Term> also bans a category of weapons and encourages the peaceful uses of biological agents and toxins, but it does not create an organisation to verify its application. The <Term t="NPT">Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty</Term> encourages the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, but it does not ban nuclear weapons for all states. It delegates verification activities to the <Term t="IAEA">International Atomic Energy Agency</Term>, an organisation that pre-dates the treaty.

The CWC comprises 24 articles and 3 annexes for a total of 165 pages. In comparison, the BWC comprises 15 articles, and the NPT 11.

The CWC includes different categories of provisions:

- provisions common to most treaties: preamble, definitions, general obligations, settlement of disputes, amendments, duration and withdrawal, conclusion and entry into force, reservations, depositary (see Chapter 3 on related areas of international law for more information about treaty law)
- provisions specific to the subject matter: declarations, chemical weapons, chemical weapons production facilities, activities not prohibited under the convention, economic and technological development, assistance and protection against CW, annexes on verification and confidentiality
- national implementation<Term t="national implementation">national implementation</Term> measures
- mechanisms to raise and redress situations of non-compliance
- institutional provisions establishing the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, its mandate, structure, and privileges and immunities
