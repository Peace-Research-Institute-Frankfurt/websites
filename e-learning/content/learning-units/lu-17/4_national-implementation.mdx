**According to Article 27 of the Vienna Convention** on the law of treaties, a state party may not invoke the provisions of its national law as justification for its failure to perform its obligations under a treaty. The process by which a state adopts appropriate and effective national legislative or regulatory measures to carry out and enforce its international obligations is called national implementation.

The relationship between international law and national law is often described in terms of dualism or monism. Dualist states treat the two as separate systems of law, while monist states view them as one body of law. In practice, this difference is less important, as international obligations usually require implementation in national legislation, regardless of dualism or monism.

For example, the Chemical Weapons Convention requires its states parties to enact penal legislation and UN Security Council Resolution 1540 requires states to adopt and enforce appropriate effective laws.

Let us now have a look at the different categories of measures that need to be adopted to give effect to international instruments on non-proliferation and disarmament. These firstly include definitions of important terms such as biological weapons, nuclear material, and non-state actors.

The second category comprises offences and penalties to prohibit and sanction all activities with CBRN weapons and certain activities with related materials. If possible, these offences should apply to both natural and legal persons (for example companies). The state should be able to prosecute alleged offenders if the crime occurred beyond its territory, for example on the basis of the nationality of the perpetrator or the victim. These are known as jurisdictional provisions.

The third category concerns measures to ensure the security and safety of CBRN materials. Specific measures include: the adoption of lists of items (for example biological agents) that will be subject to control and their physical protection.
The fourth category entails measures to control transfers (that is to say, import, export, re-export, transshipment and transit) of materials and equipment and technology.

The last category consists of enforcement systems. This includes the establishment of national authorities, national inspections of activities with controlled materials, and criminal investigations.

The categories I have just mentioned cover different areas of national law. They may be incorporated into criminal law, public health law, customs law, etc.

## Implementing the Biological Weapons Convention

According to IV of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, each state party shall take any necessary measures, in accordance with its constitutional process, to prohibit and prevent the development, production, stockpiling, acquisition, retention and use of biological weapons. Let us see how states have been implementing their BWC obligations.

### Some states have adopted a BWC implementing act.

- For example, the United Kingdom has a [Biological Weapons Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/6/contents) that focuses on criminal measures to prohibit the development, production, stockpiling, acquisition, possession and transfer of biological weapons.
- The Czech Republic has adopted a longer [Act on ‘Measures Related to Prohibition of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Amendments to Trades Licensing Act’](https://www.sujb.cz/en/legal-framework/prohibition-of-biological-weapons); it covers criminal measures, but also measures to handle biological agents and toxins for peaceful activities in a secure manner.

### Some states have adopted specific legislation on biosafety and biosecurity to control peaceful activities with biological agents and toxins that could be diverted to non-peaceful uses.

- Canada’s [Human Pathogens and Toxins Act](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/H-5.67/) establishes a safety and security regime to protect the health and safety of the public against the risks posed by human biological agents and toxins. As such, it helps prevent the possibility of such agents and toxins being used as biological weapons.

### Other states have opted for a “weapons of mass destruction” law including provisions on biological weapons.

- For example, India has a Weapons of Mass Destruction law to implement the BWC, but also the CWC and nuclear-related obligations.
- South Africa also has a [Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction Act](https://www.gov.za/documents/non-proliferation-weapons-mass-destruction-act-2-jul-1993-0000#), with separate regulations on nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and materials.  

## Drafting Process for Implementing Legislation on Non-Proliferation and Disarmament

### Advising / Deciding on

- Legislative drafters advise on an approach to national implementation: stand-alone legislation, multiple laws and regulations, etc.
- The lead coordinates the decision making process for the timely drafting, review and adoption of draft legislation

### Drafting

- A legislative drafting committee is formed at the national level
- The lead coordinates a national review process to review draft laws and regulations
- The drafting committee/government can request international legislative drafting and review assistance

### Adopting

- Laws and regularions are adopted

## Available Assistance and Tools to Draft Implementing Legislation

Drafting non-proliferation and disarmament legislation requires technical and legal expertise as well as financial and human resources that not all states may have. There are therefore a number of available tools and programmes to assist those states in developing their legislation.

### Legislative assistance providers

They provide assistance themselves. This is the role of intergovernmental organisations (IOs) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) within the limits of their specific mandates, budgets and according to their processes – the latter may be more flexible for NGOs.

- [IAEA Legislative Assistance and Tools](https://www.iaea.org/services/legislative-assistance)
- [CTBT Legal Resources](https://www.ctbto.org/member-states/legal-resources/)
- OPCW Legislative Assistance and Tools
- [Internship Programme for Legal Drafters and National Authority Representatives](https://www.opcw.org/resources/capacity-building/national-implementation-programmes/internship-programme-legal-drafters)
- National Legislation – Implementation Kit for the Chemical Weapons Convention 
- VERTIC’s National Implementation Measures Programme
- [Parliamentarians for Global Action’s Campaign for Universality and Implementation of the BWC and UNSCR 1540.](https://www.pgaction.org/ips/bsh/)

### Legislative assistance brokers

They facilitate assistance provided by others.

- BWC Implementation Support Unit: acts as a clearing house for assistance with national implementation.
- UNSCR 1540 Committee group of experts: facilitates assistance between states, and between states and international organisations.
