## What is international law?

International law is the body of norms governing the relations between its subjects. This includes states, first and foremost, but also others, such as international organisations.

International law regulates different fields of cooperation ranging from terrorism, outer space and global communications to human rights, the environment and non-proliferation and disarmament.

## How are international law and non-proliferation and disarmament law related?

International non-proliferation and disarmament law forms part of international law and is one of its many “sub-regimes”. The founding and functioning principles of non-proliferation and disarmament law are therefore aligned with those of international law.

This holds true with regard to:

- the sources of international non-proliferation and- disarmament law
- its subjects
- its application

## Do international law and international non-proliferation and disarmament law really work?

The flaws of international law often show in dramatic and difficult situations such as wars and severe political and social upheaval. These shortcomings receive much attention in the media, causing public opinion to question the usefulness, or sometimes even existence, of international law.

However, as noted by renowned scholar Louis Henkin,

Almost all nations observe almost all principles of international law and almost all of their obligations almost all of the time.

As the “100 Ways” project described in the next section demonstrates, almost all of the time we may just not be aware of it.

Moreover, even at such challenging times as armed or political conflict, states consistently seek to justify their acts on the basis of international law. This demonstrates that states consider themselves bound by the rules they have set, whatever the circumstances.

During certain periods of time or certain events, states may deny and defy international law, but this will almost always come at a political or economic cost in their relations with other states.

The [100 Ways project](https://www.asil.org/resources/100Ways) of the American Society of International Law shows that international law is so deeply and comprehensively ingrained into everyday life that its existence can be easily overlooked. The project gives a 100 examples of how international law works across eight areas: daily life, leisure, travel, commerce, health and the environment, personal liberty, safety and development, and peace and security. 

To give one such example, mailing a postcard to any country across the globe is easy, because of the 1964 Constitution of the Universal Postal Union, which sets up a worldwide postal network and ensures that the stamp you bought is recognised for mail delivery by all other states.

As for peace and security, another example is “banning cruel and inhumane weapons such as sarin gas” (International Law: 100 Ways It Shapes Our Lives ). This is done by a number of treaties including the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention and the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. These treaties form part of international non-proliferation and disarmament law.
