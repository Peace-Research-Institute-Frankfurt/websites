## Introduction to Treaty Law

This video lecture covers international non-proliferation and disarmament law in relation to treaty law, specifically:

- Role of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties
- Creation of treaties
- Joining of treaties
- General principle of international law Pacta sunt servanda
- Termination of treaties

## Joining Treaties

### What is a treaty?

<Quote type="document" cite="Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), Article 2(1)(a)">

an international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law, whether embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments and whatever its particular designation

</Quote>

To join a multilateral treaty (a treaty that is open to three or more states), a state has to express its ‘consent to be bound’ by that treaty. This usually happens through either ratification or accession procedures:

1. a state has signed or wishes to sign the treaty while it is open for signature, it will follow the ratification procedure (see section 1).
2. If a state has not signed the treaty while it was open for signature, it can join by going through the accession procedure (see section 2).

### Consent to be bound by ratification

<Quote type="document" cite="Article 11, VCLT.">

The consent of a state to be bound by a treaty may be expressed by […] ratification […].

</Quote>

1. Step 1 – Signature: state signs the treaty, often during a ceremony
2. Step 2 – Domestic approval: state seeks domestic approval for the ratification of the treaty
3. Step 3 – Deposit of Instrument of Ratification: state deposits its ‘instrument of ratification’, usually a very short, signed document, with the depositary (who is responsible for administering the treaty), which establishes the state’s consent to be bound

### Consent to be bound by accession

<Quote type="document" cite="Article 11, VCLT">

The consent of a State to be bound by a treaty may be expressed by […] accession […].

</Quote>

This procedure usually applies if a state has not signed a treaty, for example because the timeframe for signature has closed. In that case, ratification is no longer possible, but accession is.

1. Step 1 – Domestic approval: state seeks domestic approval for accession to the treaty
2. Step 2 – Deposit of Instrument of Accession: state deposits its ‘instrument of accession,’ usually a very short, signed document, with the depositary (who is responsible for administering the treaty), which establishes the state’s consent to be bound

## Pacta sunt servanda

### Entry into force

“Entry into force” of a treaty refers to the date on which the treaty becomes binding on the states that have expressed their consent to be bound it.

Multilateral treaties commonly require a certain number of states to have expressed their consent to be bound for the treaty to enter into force. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, for example, even names the states whose consent to be bound is necessary for the treaty to enter into force (see CTBT, Article XIV, para 1).

Multilateral treaties usually also specify when the treaty shall enter into force for states that express their consent to be bound after a treaty has already entered into force (see for example CTBT, Article XIV, para 5).

Pacta sunt servanda (Latin for “agreements must be kept”): every treaty in force is binding upon its states parties. They must perform it in good faith (VCLT, Article 26) .

### Example: Comprehensive test ban treaty

Article XIV: Entry into force

<Quote type="document">

1. This Treaty shall enter into force 180 days after the date of deposit of the instruments of ratification by all States listed in Annex 2 to this Treaty, but in no case earlier than two years after its opening for signature.

[…]

5. For States whose instruments of ratification or accession are deposited subsequent to the entry into force of this Treaty, it shall enter into force on the 30th day following the date of deposit of their instruments of ratification or accession.

</Quote>

### States who?

States that have signed, but not yet ratified a treaty are often referred to as Signatory States. As signatories, these states have the obligation "to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of that treaty."[^1]

- states that have expressed their consent to be bound (by either ratification or accession) and for which the treaty is in force = States Parties
- states that have expressed their consent to be bound (by either ratification or accession), whether or not the treaty has entered into force = Contracting States

Sometimes multilateral treaties establish international organisations. For example, the Chemical Weapons Convention establishes the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. States Parties to the CWC are then also Member States of the OPCW (Article VIII (2)).

## Interpreting and Amending Treaties

### General Rule of Interpretation of Treaties (VCLT, Article 31)

Treaties shall be interpreted in good faith and in accordance with the ordinary meaning of their terms. However, the ordinary meaning will also depend on a treaty’s context and in light of its object and purpose.

Context refers to a treaty’s:

- preamble
- annexes
- agreements and instruments made in connection with the conclusion of the treaty

Together with the context, the following shall be taken into account:

- subsequent agreements and practice regarding interpretation of the treaty
- any relevant rules of international law applicable to states parties’ relations

A special meaning to a term shall be given if it is established that the states parties so intended. This would require a high level of evidence.

### Supplementary Means of Interpretation of Treaties (VCLT, Article 32)

Supplementary means of interpretation may be used as a recourse to confirm or determine the meaning of terms if the general rule of interpretation in Article 31:

A) Leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure, or

B) Leads to a manifestly absurd or unreasonable result.

Supplementary means of interpretation include the preparatory works of a treaty (known as travaux préparatoires) and the circumstances of the conclusion of a treaty.

### Amending Treaties

If states parties wish to alter treaty provisions, they can engage in a process to amend the treaty. In multilateral treaties, this process is usually outlined in one of the final articles of the treaty.

For example, States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention agreed to make changes to one of its annexes (amendments to annexes are referred to as ‘changes’ in the CWC). In November 2019, the Conference of States Parties agreed to add two families of toxic chemicals, known as novichok, to Schedule 1 of the Annex on Chemicals.

The procedure for these changes are outlined in Article XV of the CWC:

<Quote type="document">

1. Any State Party may propose amendments to this Convention. Any State Party may also propose changes, as specified in paragraph 4, to the Annexes of this Convention

[…].

4. All changes to the Annex on Chemicals shall be made in accordance with paragraph 5.

</Quote>

Paragraph 5 establishes clear procedures for each step, including:

1. submission of the proposal for changes
2. circulation of the proposal to all States Parties
3. evaluation of the proposal
4. approval procedures
5. circulation of the adopted proposal
6. entry into force of the proposed changes

## Law on the Use of Force

So far we have looked at treaty law as one of the areas of international law that applies to non-proliferation and disarmament law.

Another area of international law that is relevant is the international law on states’ use of force. Article 2 paragraph 4 of the UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of force by states, but there are exceptions to this rule. One is states’ right to self-defence in response to an armed attack in Article 51 of the UN Charter. Another is the authorisation of the use of force by the UN Security Council under Article 42 in Chapter VII of the UN Charter.

There are several prominent examples where international disarmament and non-proliferation law and the law on the use of force intersected, even if the legality of the use of force is debated.

One example is the use of force by the United States, United Kingdom and others in light of Iraq’s disarmament obligations in March 2003. Another is the use of force by the United States and others in response to the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
As you have heard in Chapter 1, the International Court of Justice, or ICJ, gave an Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons. The Court considered the law on the use of force, but stated that it could not give a definitive answer whether the threat or use of nuclear weapons “in an extreme circumstance of self-defence” would be lawful or not.

## Focus on Law on the Use of Force

The use of force by states in international law is governed by both customary and treaty law, with the UN Charter being the most relevant source:

Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of force:

<Quote type="document">

All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.

</Quote>

Exceptions to this prohibition exist:

<Quote type="document" cite="Article 51 of the UN Charter">

Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security […]

</Quote>

Chapter VII of the UN Charter provides for enforcement measures that can be taken by the UN Security Council, including the authorisation of the use of force.

## International Humanitarian, Criminal and Human Rights Law

Regardless of whether the use of force by a state is lawful or not, any resulting armed conflict is governed by international humanitarian law, or IHL, also known as the law of armed conflict. The International Committee of the Red Cross, or ICRC, acts as the ‘guardian’ of this body of law, which only applies during armed conflict, so not during peacetime.

By balancing the principles of military necessity and humanity, IHL regulates the conduct of armed conflict in order to protect both civilians and combatants. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional Protocols are well-known treaties of this area of law.

IHL applies to both conventional and CBRN weapons. With regard to biological and chemical weapons, their use is prohibited by customary rules of IHL. With regard to nuclear weapons, in the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, the majority of the ICJ supported the view that, “the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict.”

Another related IHL requirement with regard to CBRN materials is for example Article 56 of Additional Protocol I, which in principle prohibits attacks on nuclear power plants.

Certain violations of IHL can amount to war crimes. Individuals that are allegedly responsible for these crimes can be prosecuted in national and international courts according to the rules of international criminal law. For example, the Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court includes the use of poison weapons and biological weapons in armed conflict as war crimes. These crimes were included as amendments to the Statute in 2010 and 2017 respectively.

Other international crimes are crimes against humanity, genocide and aggression. For example, the use of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons specifically directed against a particular group could amount to genocide.

Finally, in peacetime and in armed conflict, international human rights law applies. This is the body of international law that grants protection to individuals, including for example every human being’s right to life or right to a fair trial.
There are various international and regional treaties that protect and enforce human rights. The European Convention on Human Rights is a regional treaty that establishes the European Court of Human Rights.

A relevant case of this Court is Finogenov and others v. Russia, in which the Court determined that the use of toxic chemicals by the Russian authorities to incapacitate hostage takers in a theatre in Moscow did not amount to a violation of the right to life, but inadequate planning and conduct of the rescue operation and failure to conduct an effective investigation into the rescue operation did.

## Focus on International Humanitarian Law

Regardless of whether the use of force was lawful or not, any resulting armed conflict is governed by international humanitarian law (IHL), also known as the law of armed conflict (LOAC).

IHL only applies at the time of an armed conflict, so not during peacetime. It regulates the conduct of armed conflict in order to [protect](https://casebook.icrc.org/) both civilians and combatants. While IHL does not prohibit the use of violence, regulating it provides some relief and protection to all parties involved.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) acts as the ‘guardian’ of IHL. It promotes the development of IHL and its implementation in national law.

The Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols are treaties that form a crucial part of international humanitarian law.

With regard to CBRN materials, Additional Protocol I, for example, generally prohibits attacks on nuclear power stations.

In addition, customary international lawprovides relevant rules, including the prohibition of the use of chemical and biological weapons in armed conflict.

IHL also consists of principles , such as the principle of distinction between civilians, who are protected from attack, and combatants, who are permitted to directly participate in hostilities and may therefore be attacked.

## Focus on International Criminal Law

### The International Criminal Court

The ICC is a permanent international criminal court based in The Hague, the Netherlands. It is established by the 1998 Rome Statute, which currently has 123 States Parties.

#### The Court's Jurisdiction

The Court has jurisdiction over ‘the most serious crimes of international concern’.

These include:

- the crime of aggression: the planning, preparation, initiation or execution of the use of force which constitutes a manifest violation of the UN Charter (see also page 27)
- war crimes: grave breaches and other serious violations of IHL (see also page 29)
- crimes against humanity: certain acts committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population. Unlike war crimes, crimes against humanity can also be committed during peacetime
- the crime of genocide: certain acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. Like crimes against humanity, genocide can be committed during peacetime and armed conflict, but unlike crimes against humanity, genocide is targeted towards a specific group

#### Amendments

Article 8 of the Rome Statute was amended in 2010 to include the use of poison or poisoned weapons and asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases as war crimes in non-international armed conflict (i.e. an armed conflict between a state and a non-state armed group or between non-state armed groups).

Article 8 was amended again in 2017 to include the use of biological and toxin weapons as war crimes both during international and non-international armed conflict.

## Focus on International Human Rights Law

International human rights law IHRL grants protection to all individuals. It applies both during peacetime and armed conflict, although during the latter IHL takes precedence.

There are various international and regional treaties that protect and enforce human rights, including the European Convention on Human Rights which establishes the European Court of Human Rights ECHR in Strasbourg, France.
An example of the overlap between international human rights law and non-proliferation and disarmament law is the use of riot control agents.

While the Chemical Weapons Convention allows for the use of riot control agents for law enforcement purposes, such use is also governed by international human rights law. The ECHR noted this in, among other cases, Ali Güneş v. Turkey .

In this case, the Court held that the use of tear gas on a participant in a protest after his arrest was a violation of his right in Article 3 of the Convention to not be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment.
