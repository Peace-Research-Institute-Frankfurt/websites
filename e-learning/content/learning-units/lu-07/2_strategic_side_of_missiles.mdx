## Strategic considerations for missile procurement

Given the different types of missiles, what types of missiles are states most likely to procure? There is no easy answer to this, and it depends on a range of factors, most notably the exact requirements of the operator, the ability to manufacture the weapon system domestically or its availability on the international arms market, the availability of platforms for launching missiles, and relative costs, among others.

Importantly, every type of missile has distinct advantages and disadvantages. For example, ballistic missiles and boost-glide vehicles are ideal weapon systems for time-sensitive targets due to their low time-to-target, but comparatively expensive and difficult to manufacture. Subsonic cruise missiles can often provide the highest levels of accuracy while maintaining a stealthy approach. At the same time, they are rather slow and if they are detected, they are relatively easy to intercept. Long-range drones and rocket artillery constitute comparatively cheap and potentially more easily available options but may lack the survivability and yield necessary to reliably destroy their targets.

Therefore, states wanting to build up a formidable missile arsenal will ideally be able to procure a mix of missile capabilities, allowing them to flexibly choose in different scenarios. However, this will not be realistic for most states, given the budgetary constraints they face and/or their inability to procure the weapon system, even if they wanted to. This is either because they are unable to manufacture certain types of missiles at home or because they cannot buy them on the international arms market. In addition, states may lack access to certain platforms, such as surface vessels or aircraft, preventing them from deploying certain types of missiles, such as air-launched cruise missiles or submarine-launched ballistic missiles, for example.

As such, with the exception of a few powerful states that have significant financial, industrial and military resources to deploy large and diverse missile arsenals (arguably only the United States, China and potentially Russia, at present), most states will not be able to build the missile arsenals of their dreams. Instead, they will have to adapt their needs to the material realities within which they conduct their arms procurements.

## Missile proliferation

Missiles have proliferated significantly since the end of the World War Two. [^1] This has especially been the case since the end of the Cold War, and even more so in recent years. Reasons for this relate both to the demand side and the supply side of missile proliferation. On one hand, missiles provide enormous military utility for their possessor states both in conventional and nuclear warfare. On the other hand, missiles have become increasingly available due to a horizontalisation of missile manufacturing capabilities across the globe.

### Demand side drivers

  Missile arsenals can provide key advantages in both short and protracted warfighting scenarios, as demonstrated in recent wars and conflicts. Missiles can play an instrumental role in creating the conditions for victory at the outset of a conflict by inflicting “shock and awe” and rapidly undermining the adversary’s warfighting potential and its morale, even before larger military operations are underway.

  For example, the United States employed large-scale missile strikes at the outset of Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 to launch their campaigns against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, targeting key military installations, leadership headquarters, critical infrastructure and air defence sites.

  Although the ultimate effectiveness of these missile attacks is still debated, they left a lasting impression on observers. The prospect of large-scale missile strikes rapidly undermining the warfighting capacity of a state before a coordinated military response could be formulated and implemented became real and daunting. Accordingly, states started to invest heavily in missile defences, but also acquired substantial missile arsenals of their own and developed comprehensive missile doctrines for employment in conventional and nuclear war.

  Russia similarly started its invasion of Ukraine with a large-scale missile attack. Although the immediate effects of this attack were underwhelming, the war in Ukraine has demonstrated the advantages missile capabilities can provide in protracted warfighting scenarios. Missile strikes have placed Ukraine and its international partners under tremendous pressure in the medium- to long-term both by threatening critical civilian infrastructure and terrorising the Ukrainian population through direct strikes on population centres.

  Ukraine for its part has employed domestic and foreign missile capabilities to destroy Russian logistics depots, military targets and command and control facilities in occupied Ukrainian territory, as well as critical infrastructure and industry targets deep inside Russia. Ukraine would undoubtedly be in a worse position today without access to Western and domestic missile capabilities.

  In terms of nuclear strategy, missiles, for now, remain the most effective and survivable delivery vehicles for both strategic and non-strategic nuclear warheads.

  Recent conflicts have shown that both air-breathing and non-air-breathing missiles are more vulnerable to missile defences than previously thought. However, they are generally still more survivable than aircraft deploying nuclear gravity bombs, unless perhaps those aircraft are equipped with advanced stealth capabilities. Additionally, unlike aircraft-deployed gravity bombs that require operators to penetrate the adversary’s weapons engagement zone, stand-off missiles can generate effects without risking the safety of the operators and their platforms.

  What is more, the utility of missiles in creating timely effects remains unmatched. Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) can reach the other side of the planet within 20 to 30 minutes. At shorter ranges, SRBMs can engage targets 500 to 1,000 km away in just 3 to 7 minutes. Aircraft deploying gravity bombs cannot match these timeframes, especially if they are initially grounded. Consequently, states with nuclear arsenals will remain highly invested in advancing their missile programmes to ensure the effectiveness of their nuclear deterrents. Overall, this indicates a significant demand for missile capabilities for both conventional and nuclear warfare.

### Supply side drivers

  For a long time, the number of countries capable of manufacturing missiles has been relatively small. During the Cold War, this capacity was primarily limited to the Soviet Union, the United States and a few other advanced economies, mostly in Europe, with significant industrial manufacturing capabilities. Although some countries in Latin America and Africa attempted to develop and produce indigenous missile designs, they were largely unsuccessful. This was partly due to counter-proliferation measures designed to limit the global spread of missile technology, which will be discussed in the next section.

  **Missile Production Capabilities before the 1980s**

  In around the 1980s, the number of missile-producing states started to increase, albeit at a rather slow pace. This has changed in the last two decades, which have witnessed a dramatic horizontalisation of missile manufacturing technology. This applies to both air-breathing and non-air-breathing missile designs. Nowadays, even states that have not traditionally been known for their advanced manufacturing capabilities and defence industries are involved in the design and production of different kinds of missiles.

  This does not mean that it has become easy to manufacture missiles or that manufacturing capabilities for all types of missiles have spread equally. For example, while many more states now manufacture ASCMs, the number of states building their own ballistic missiles remains relatively small

  Additionally, the most advanced missiles are still produced by states with traditionally strong positions in the global missile market and with advanced industrial manufacturing capabilities. However, the emergence of states such as South Korea, which had no market share during the Cold War but is now a leading missile producer and exporter, along with the increase in the raw number of missile-producing states, indicates that the global missile market has been disrupted by new suppliers of missile technology.

  Overall, increasing availability on the supply side, coupled with growing global demand for missile technology, has resulted in an international environment that is prone to proliferation. Further, as the sections below demonstrate, the availability and effectiveness of dedicated missile counter-proliferation tools is limited.

## Missile defence
Although not the main focus of this learning unit, it is useful to briefly consider the requirements for effective missile defence, given that they directly relate to the characteristics of the types of missile capabilities outlined above. Further, it's important to recognise that missile defence is not just a technical issue but also a deeply political one, especially considering its implications in the nuclear domain.

Modern missile defence systems consist of several elements. Typically, this includes a radar system that detects and potentially classifies incoming threats, the interceptor that engages incoming missile projectiles, one or several launcher units that launch said interceptors and a command and control unit that coordinates the missile defence engagement, for example by prioritising and allocating targets. Depending on the missile defence system, two or more of these elements may be integrated into one vehicle or combat station.

Depending on the type of missile threat the missile defence system is defending against, the set-up and capabilities of the missile defence system differ, especially in terms of the radar and the interceptor. Missile defence systems optimised to engage non-air-breathing threats, such as ballistic missiles, must be equipped with radars that can look high up into and potentially outside the atmosphere to detect and track incoming objects, and to guide an interceptor to the missile target. Given the trajectory of ballistic missiles, ballistic missile defence radars must be able to detect targets at high altitudes and at fairly long ranges.

In contrast, missile defence systems optimised for engaging air-breathing threats, such as cruise missiles, typically employ radars that scan for targets much closer to the ground, due to the relatively low altitude from which these threats approach. This means that the radar often has to deal with much more radar clutter, such as birds, treetops, buildings and terrain features that are not present at higher levels of the atmosphere. To overcome this, low-altitude radars employ clutter maps, mechanical and software-based filtering techniques, and narrow beam widths, among others. However, there are trade-offs between the radar’s ability to discriminate clutter and its range, limiting the distance at which low-altitude objects can be detected.

Given the longer range of engagement, interceptor missiles optimised for defending against high-altitude non-air-breathing threats are typically equipped with larger boosters and sometimes consist of several stages, similar to some types of ballistic missiles. These types of interceptors can also be equipped with a kill vehicle that separates from the booster to intercept the incoming missile threat, either by directly colliding with the projectile or by detonating a warhead. Depending on the range of the ballistic missile being engaged, interception may take place outside the atmosphere. In this case, late stage manoeuvring can be difficult for the interceptor due to the low atmospheric density. To retain the manoeuvrability necessary to successfully engage incoming missiles and RVs, thrust motors on the interceptor may be necessary. In contrast, interceptors optimised to engage air-breathing threats are usually single stage, employ fragmentation warheads and rely on aerodynamic control surfaces for manoeuvring, which is feasible due to the higher atmospheric density at lower altitudes.

The important thing to remember is that the flight profile and characteristics of the missile system matter for missile defence. Moreover, given the different requirements for distinct types of missiles, not every type of missile defence system will be able to deal with every type of missile threat. This is why analysts typically talk about the need to deploy layered missile defence systems whereby different types of missile defence capabilities defend a target area together.[^2]

For example, if a state only deploys missile defence systems optimised to defend against non-air-breathing threats such as ballistic missiles, the defended area may still be vulnerable to air-breathing threats, such as cruise missiles. In addition, the attacker might be able to attack and destroy the ballistic missile defence system with a cruise missile, and can subsequently attack the target area again with ballistic missiles and other types of non-air-breathing threats. Different types of missile defence systems must therefore not only coordinate to defend a certain target area, but also to defend one another against distinct types of missile threats.

As outlined above, missile defence has always had a strong political dimension, especially within the context of nuclear strategy. During the Cold War, ballistic missile defence was often seen as an offensive capability. This perception stemmed from the potential for such systems to enable a nuclear first strike by intercepting and neutralising an adversary’s remaining nuclear weapons after an initial attack, thereby undermining the assured second-strike capability of a nuclear-armed state.

In response, the United States and the Soviet Union signed the **Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)** Treaty in 1972 ([see also LU20](/lu-20/)). This treaty limited each superpower to two missile defence complexes each, with no more than 100 interceptors deployed – an amount deemed insufficient to threaten the adversary’s assured retaliatory capability. While the Soviet Union decided to place their system near Moscow, the US placed theirs near an ICBM base not far from Grand Forks, North Dakota.

Despite this agreement, strategic missile defence remained controversial.[^3] Thirty years after the treaty was signed, the George W. Bush administration withdrew from the ABM Treaty, citing a growing ballistic missile threat from “rogue actors” such as Iran and North Korea.

Missile defence has since been a contentious issue in NATO-Russia and US-China relations. China and Russia accuse the United States and its European and Asian allies of undermining strategic stability by increasing their missile defence capabilities, especially in combination with other types of advanced non-nuclear technologies. [^4] Conversely, the United States and its partners argue that these deployments are essential due to the rising conventional missile threat from various actors, most notably China and Russia.
