title: The national implementation of export controls

<LectureVideo smil="/lu12/HSFK-PC_LU12-CH05_12a_241219.smil" provider="video-stream">
  The current multilateral architecture on arms and dual-use export controls consists of a complex set of instruments, from treaties to UN Security Council resolutions, export control regimes and transparency measures – each with a different membership.

  States then need to implement these instruments at the national level. The legal nature of each multilateral instrument has implications for the degree of freedom that states have to structure and apply the controls:

 - At the EU level, for example, all member states have a legal obligation to implement the EU Common Position on Arms Exports and the EU Dual-Use Regulation.
 - When it comes to export control regimes, all regime members have a political obligation to control transfers of all items on the control lists.
 - And in both cases, the decision on whether or not to grant an export licence remains with each individual state.

  To implement the obligations and standards arising from multilateral instruments on dual-use and arms export controls, states have developed national export control systems. These include a legal framework and control list, competent authorities with defined competencies and a system for enforcing the controls. The overall objective of such a system is to have control over exports of arms and dual-use items and to be able to prevent certain transfers from taking place, as well as to detect, investigate and prosecute violations should they occur.

  While states have substantial freedom in how they choose to develop their national export control system, there are features that are common to many of these systems, in terms of the framework, the actors involved in the controls and the different stages at which the controls are implemented. This chapter will cover those features.

## Elements of a national control system

- As a first step, states must adopt legislation to regulate arms and dual-use transfers, authorisation procedures, their enforcement and how to sanction any violations. This regulatory framework should also establish a ‘national control list’, i.e. a list of items that are subject to export controls.
- The framework should also identify a competent authority responsible for issuing export authorisations or licences to companies and other entities (e.g. universities) for the transfer of arms or dual-use items. A decision on whether to grant a licence tends to be based on two factors: the end-use and the end-user within the destination country (which may give rise to specific risks or issues of political acceptability). Therefore, applicants usually have to provide information about the end-user and the end-use the items will be put to, as well as the type of items. This information will then be assessed by the licensing authority. For assessments that are particularly sensitive, an inter-agency committee can be set up with representatives from the defence, foreign policy, economic, intelligence agencies and/or ministries.[^1]
- To enforce the controls, several entities and methods are commonly used, including customs controls, border controls, telecommunications monitoring, criminal investigations and computer surveillance. A key element of enforcement is frequent checks at the borders, using trained customs officers with adequate resources and up-to-date procedures which allow them to selectively target some of the riskiest shipments. But these physical checks are not sufficient, especially with the increasing volume of ITT. Complementary investigative methods, such as intelligence gathering are therefore also used.
- Authorities also raise awareness and conduct outreach activities among industry and other actors that could be subject to the controls. Outreach can focus on the applicable regulations as well as the risks that come with noncompliance, such as the proliferation of technologies which can be used in WMD, or the diversion of arms and ammunition to unintended end-users. Through outreach, the authorities can also establish a dialogue and communication channels with the actors subject to controls, and gain insights on the practical challenges they are facing.[^2] In addition to this, compliance and due diligence processes within companies are essential.[^3]

## Main actors

### In a national export control system:
<DetailsGroup>
  <Details open={true} summary="Licensing Authorities">

    Licensing authorities are the competent authorities responsible for issuing export authorisations or licences. In some countries, the competent authority is located within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in others in the Ministry of Defence or Economy. In other countries, this authority is autonomous and not part of a particular ministry.

  </Details>

  <Details open={true} summary="Customs and Law Enforcement">

    Customs, border control authorities and other law enforcement authorities such as the police are in charge of enforcing the controls, including at the state’s borders, and are involved in the investigation of export control violations.

  </Details>

  <Details open={true} summary="Inter-Agency Committees">

    Relevant ministries and agencies in the fields of defence, foreign policy and economy usually participate in inter-agency committees to provide advice, or in many cases to jointly assess licence applications.

  </Details>

  <Details open={true} summary="Parliaments">

    Parliaments are involved in drafting and adopting national legislation, and in some cases in the ratification of treaties and international commitments. In a very limited number of states, the parliament has a role in overseeing the implementation of national export control systems (for example through the work of specialised oversight committees). Many parliaments are also involved in the scrutiny of national reports on arms transfers, which they sometimes need to approve.

  </Details>

  <Details open={true} summary="National Courts">

    National courts prosecute export control violations. In some states, national courts also play a role in examining challenges to state decisions to grant or approve licences.

## In the transfer of arms and dual-use items:

<DetailsGroup>
  <Details open={true} summary="Industry">

    Exporting companies, brokers and actors providing other services, such as traders, transport agents and freight forwarders; as well as banks and insurance companies.

  </Details>

  <Details open={true} summary="Research Organisations">

    Universities and research institutes can also be subject to export controls. In particular, they can be involved in ITT through collaborative research projects and through the production and dissemination of their research findings.

## Controls throughout the transfer chain

States apply export controls before, during and after the transfer of arms or dual-use items:

Pre-transfer controls:
- Context analysis and risk assessment by the competent authority, which considers a range of prohibitions and risks. Prohibitions are circumstances in which states must prohibit transfers of arms or dual-use items. They include UN arms embargoes (all UN member states), as well as EU arms embargoes for EU member states. When an export is not prohibited, the state assesses the potential risks that this export entails. The Wassenaar Arrangement good practices, the Arms Trade Treaty and the EU Common Position are useful in this regard as they clarify the application of standards relating to IHL/IHRL, economic development, conflict prevention and diversion, and promote harmonisation of national practices.[^4]
- Beyond this, states also take into account their own foreign and security and economic concerns, such as their industrial and political relations with foreign states and their wider foreign and security policy priorities.[^5]

In-transfer controls:
- arms and dual-use items are particularly vulnerable to diversion to illicit markets during their transfer, especially through transit and transshipment via third countries. A transit refers to the transportation of goods from a country of origin to a country of destination through the territory of a third country, during which the goods remain on board the transport facility (boat, plane, train or lorry). If they are unloaded and reloaded, this constitutes a particular type of transit called transshipment.[^6]

Post-shipment controls:
- the granting of authorisations may also be conditional on the acceptance of additional requests and guarantees by the recipient country, such as the signature upon delivery of the military materiel or the prior signature of a certificate confirming the presence of the agreed end-user of the materiel. Some countries also make it a condition that physical ‘post-shipment on-site inspections’ of the supplied items be carried out a few years after delivery.

<Callout title="Post-shipment on-site inspections">

  Post-shipment on-site inspections are one of the post-shipment control measures that some states have used to mitigate arms diversion risks. Post-shipment on-site inspections involve an exporting state requiring and then conducting physical checks on the territory of the importing state of military materiel the exporting state previously transferred.[^7] Such inspections can be helpful in verifying that an importing state is adhering to end-user assurances, as well as enabling a dialogue between importing and exporting states about measures to prevent diversion – thereby building trust and fostering cooperation.

  Historically, the US has implemented several programmes which foresee post-shipment checks, including the Blue Lantern programme since 1990.[^8] These post-shipment checks can be carried out on all exports and are based on the extra-territorial application of US export controls. This is a very comprehensive approach, developed over a long period of time. In the last decade, a growing number of European states have also decided to adopt and start conducting on-site inspections. These states mostly use on-site inspections in a more targeted way, focusing on certain types of materiel and destinations where diversion risks are deemed to be higher.

  Post-shipment on-site inspections are just one example of the many pre and post-shipment control measures that states can adopt. They also come with a range of challenges, including political sensitivities and resource constraints, which states that implement them need to address.[^9] Yet, states using this tool have highlighted that it can be an effective way to reinforce cooperation between importing and exporting states with a view to mitigating the risk of diversion
