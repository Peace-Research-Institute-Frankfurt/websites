## Learning objectives

In this unit, students will explore the key concepts of compliance, enforcement, and verification in international arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation agreements. They will examine why states comply with treaties, the role of international norms, and the challenges of enforcement. Through case studies, students will assess real-world compliance mechanisms, sanctions, and legal frameworks. By engaging with political, legal, and technical perspectives, students will develop critical thinking, analytical, and research skills. They will also enhance their understanding of international governance structures and the role of institutions such as the UN and treaty organizations in maintaining global security.
