My Name is Mara Zarka and I am a Research Associate and Project/Events Manager at the Vienna Centre for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation in Austria. I am also the author of this learning unit on Gender and Disarmament.

While the link between Gender and Disarmament may not be apparent at first, through our journey together the role of Gender in Disarmament, dating from the 1900s to today, will be explored. My voice will guide you on this journey and I hope you enjoy the experience!]</LectureVideo>
