Gender in disarmament dates to the 1900s when the **Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom** advocated for an end to WWI and for international disarmament.
Greater international momentum was gained during the **four UN conferences on women** which resulted in the **Beijing Platform for Action** in 1995.

In 2000, the first **Security Council resolution** 1325 was adopted reaffirming the important role of women in peace and security and the need for special measures to protect women and girls in situations of armed conflict.

Over the years, considering gender in disarmament matters evolved into an international norm with two main approaches:


1. Promoting and increasing **women’s meaningful participation** in arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament fora and decision-making bodies.
2. Applying a **gender lens** to assess the differing impacts weapons have on women and men, girls and boys, to improve policies, strategies and distribution of resources.

As the norm to adopt a **gender perspective** in disarmament policies strengthens, so does the number of **treaties, conventions and action plans** that contain gender language, including the first legally binding regime to recognize the link between gender-based violence and international arms trade – **The Arms Trade Treaty** (2014).

The EU has been very active in promoting gender equality and adopting gender mainstreaming in all its policies, but much depends on individual Member States adopting the policies into their National Action Plans.

The role of gender in disarmament has come a long way but there is still a road ahead.
