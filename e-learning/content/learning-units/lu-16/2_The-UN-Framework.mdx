**UN Framework on Gender and Disarmament**

<LectureVideo smil="lu16/lu16_vl2-1.smil" poster="https://nonproliferation-elearning.eu/learningunits/gender/vid/lu16_vl2-1.jpg" subtitles="https://nonproliferation-elearning.eu/learningunits/gender/vid/lu16_vl2-1.vtt" provider="video-stream">[The first UN Conference on Women was held in Mexico City in 1975 and was a driving force behind the UN framework. At the conference the interlinkage between equality, development and peace was established, with disarmament being part of the peace goal. Following the first conference, three subsequent conferences were held: in Copenhagen in 1980, in Nairobi in 1985 and in Beijing in 1995. Five-year review cycles followed the 1995 conference.

  The Platform for Action, unanimously adopted during the Beijing 1995 conference, outlined comprehensive commitments under 12 critical areas of concern, including recognizing the role women have played in disarmament efforts and should continue to play in decision-making fora. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, or CEDAW, adopted in 1979 under the UN General Assembly, stresses the importance of women’s participation and leadership in all policy areas, including disarmament.Both the CEDAW and Beijing Platform for Action are considered the key global reference points for gender and equality policy.In 2000 the role of women in peace and security was further realized through the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1325, which recognized for the first time:

  1. the different impact armed conflict had on women and girls compared to men and boys,
  2. women’s role in preventing and resolving conflict;
  3. called for equal participation in security and peace-making efforts and
  4. encouraged a gender component be included in all peacekeeping operations.
  5. Since UN Security Council Resolution 1325, more than six subsequent resolutions have been adopted and make up what is referred to as the Women, Peace and Security, or WPS, Agenda, that is supported by the United Nations and its Member States to better integrate women as agents of change in peace and security processes. The WPS Agenda provides the framework for gender mainstreaming in disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control, and consists, broadly speaking, of four key pillars:
  6. prevention of violence and abuse of rights
  7. participation in peace and security decisions
  8. protection in conflict; and
  9. relief and recovery in conflict and post conflict situations, with a focus on women’s needs
  10. The adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and its subsequent resolutions, has created a strong normative framework and has increased the international communities’ attention to gender perspectives and the role of women in peace and security. It is argued that among the four broad pillars, the most important is participation – emphasizing the need to recognize the active and decisive role women should have in decision-making bodies and processes..]</LectureVideo>

## Four UN World Conferences on Women

The first UN World Conference on Women was convened after the Commission on the Status of Women called for such a Conference to take place at the same time as the International Women’s Year in 1975. The first conference laid the groundwork for the subsequent conferences.

**1992 - General Recommendation 19**
Expanded the Convention to include the obligation to prevent, investigate and punish violence against women.

**2013 General Recommendation 30**

**Beijing Platform for Action – 12 Critical Areas of Concern**

The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action were adopted in 1995 at the Fourth World Conference on Women. The Platform for Action identifies 12 strategic objectives and actions to advance women and gender equality. The 12 critical areas of concern offer an important framework for governments, civil society and the public at large to focus their work and commitments to promote change and advance gender equality and women’s empowerment. Regular five-year review cycles help maintain political will and sustain momentum to achieving these objectives.

**The 12 Critical Areas of Concern are:**

1. women and the environment
2. women in power and decision-making
3. the girl child
4. women and the economy
5. women and poverty
6. violence against women

## UN Women: The Story of Resolution 1325

UN Resolution 1325 was a landmark resolution as it was the first UN Security Council resolution to acknowledge women’s experiences in conflict and peace processes to advance the international peace and security agenda.
