## SALW and Cluster Munitions

<LectureVideo smil="lu16/lu16_vl3-1.smil" poster="https://nonproliferation-elearning.eu/learningunits/gender/vid/lu16_vl3-1.jpg" subtitles="https://nonproliferation-elearning.eu/learningunits/gender/vid/lu16_vl3-1.vtt" provider="video-stream">

[The international community has increasingly acknowledged the importance of women’s participation in peace and security issues and the benefits of applying a gender perspective in developing policies. Though acknowledgement of the need for full equality between men and women dates back to the CEDAW in 1979, the enhanced recognition of the inclusion of women, in particular in peace and security matters, was strengthened through the emergence of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda and the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1325. Since then, several international documents have addressed the role of women in peace and security and the need to promote a gender perspective.

Among these the Arms Trade Treaty, or ATT, that entered into force in 2014, stands out as the first ever legally binding regime to recognize the link between gender-based violence and international arms trade. Under its Article 7, Paragraph 4 provision, arms exporting State Parties should evaluate risks of arms “being used to commit or facilitate serious acts of gender-based violence or serious acts of violence against women and children.” Should a risk be identified, then under the ATT it would be illegal to transfer weapons to a recipient State.

The UN Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects has recognized the negative impact illicit trade of small arms and light weapons, or SALW, has on women. The 2018 Outcome Document acknowledged that the eradication of SALW illicit trade is critical to combating gender based violence. Given the different impacts of SALW on gender groups, the Outcome Document encouraged gender mainstreaming in policies and programmes, and the collection of data disaggregated by gender.

Another example can be seen in the Convention on Cluster Munition, which entered into force in 2010. Under Article 5 of the Convention, States Parties are obligated to provide age- and gender-sensitive victim assistance, such as medical care, rehabilitation and psychological support, to ensure all members of society are included, and stipulates equal access to services and resources.

With the growing acknowledgment of the role of gender in disarmament, the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, which does not include a gender-related clause in its text, has since added references to gender and the need for a gender perspective in its subsequent action plans. The Maputo Action Plan and the Oslo Action Plan both call for gender mainstreaming in mine action programming, including the need for age- and gender-sensitive victim assistance, mine risk education, and collecting data disaggregated by gender and age.]

In this video you will learn about key instruments that contain gender and disarmament aspects dealing with conventional weapons, such as:

- The Arms Trade Treaty
- UN Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons (PoA)
- Convention on Cluster Munitions
- Maputo Action Plan
- Oslo Action Plan

## Small Arms and Light Weapons and Gender

**The Arms Trade Treaty** (ATT, 2014 ) is the first legally binding multilateral instrument to acknowledge the connection between international arms trade and gender-based violence (GBV).

**Article 7 (4)** states

<Quote type="document" fullDocument="?" cite="Article 7(4)">

The exporting State Party, in making this assessment, shall take into account the risk of the conventional arms covered under Article 2(1) or of the items covered under Article 3 or Article 4 in being used to commit or facilitate serious acts of gender-based violence or serious acts of violence against women and children.

</Quote>

Member States and civil society have undertaken **capacity-building efforts** to operationalize Article 7 (4). During Latvia’s ATT presidency in 2018, it announced “gender and arms related gender-based violence” as the priority theme for its presidency. The announcement provided an opportunity to deepen knowledge on the link between categories of conventional arms to which ATT applies and GBV.

**The UN Programme of Action to Reduce, Combat, and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons (UN PoA, 2001)** has also recognized the link between illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and gender-based violence.

Paragraph 14 of the **2018 Outcome Document** to the Third Review Conference states:

<Quote type="document" fullDocument="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Chance_for_Peace" cite="UN PoA,2001; Paragraph 14 of 2018 Outcome Document.">

We remain gravely concerned about the negative impact of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons on lives of women, men, girls and boys, and recognize that eradicating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons is a key part of combating gender-based violence.

## Gender and Disarmament – Resolutions, Treaties, Conventions and Working Groups

<LectureVideo smil="lu16/lu16_vl3-2.smil" poster="https://nonproliferation-elearning.eu/learningunits/gender/vid/lu16_vl3-2.jpg" subtitles="https://nonproliferation-elearning.eu/learningunits/gender/vid/lu16_vl3-2.vtt" provider="video-stream">

[Since 2010, the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on Disarmament and International Security has passed several resolutions on the subject of “Women, disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control”. The resolutions contain language on the gendered impacts of various types of weapons and women’s equal participation in discussions, decisions and actions on disarmament and international security. Resolution 65/69 was the first resolution adopted on 8 December 2010, and was led by Trinidad and Tobago to promote “equal opportunities for the representation of women in all decision-making processes with regard to matters related to disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control, in particular as it relates to the prevention and reduction of armed violence and armed conflict.” Since the first resolution was adopted, the General Assembly has committed to adopting similar resolutions every two years.

Discourse surrounding the gendered impact of nuclear weapons has also emerged in recent years.

Ionizing radiation does not affect men and women equally, and women are more vulnerable to its harmful health effects compared to men. The gendered impact of ionizing radiation has been brought to negotiations within the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, or NPT, review process, with several States Parties submitting working papers and addressing gender concerns in their national statements. The 2018 Preparatory Committee Chair’s factual summary for the NPT Review Conference recognized the disproportionate impact of ionizing radiation on women and noted that it should be included in the review cycle discussions.

The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, or TPNW, was passed in July 2017, and derived from the Humanitarian Initiative. The Treaty includes under Article 6 a clause mandating States Parties to provide age- and gender-sensitive assistance to individuals who are affected by the use or testing of nuclear weapons.

The Preamble of the TPNW also acknowledges the differing impact ionized radiation has on women, men, boys and girls, as well as the importance of “equal, full and effective participation of both women and men” in promoting peace and security.

Beyond these measures, references to women’s full and equal participation in discussions and policy-making bodies as well as the need to avoid gender bias are being considered in several additional forums. For example, gender references have been included in discussions on the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, especially when debating artificial intelligence and lethal autonomous weapons systems, as well as during working groups, such as that focused on the Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security in particular when addressing cyber space.

More attention has also been given to the full and equal participation of female delegates in disarmament discussions, especially recognizing that progress on gender parity within the NPT and other disarmament fora lags significantly behind other policy areas.]

In this video you will learn about key instruments that contain gender and disarmament aspects, such as:

- General Assembly and First Committee resolutions
- Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
- Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons
- Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons
- Open Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security

## General Assembly Resolution

UN General Assembly Resolution 65/69, 8 December 2010 was the first resolution to be adopted by the UN General Assembly’s First Committee on Disarmament and International Security focused on “Women, disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control”. The resolution focused on:

- equitable **representation of women** in all decision-making processes on matters related to disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation
- support and strengthen the effective **participation of women** in organizations in the field at the local, national, regional and sub-regional levels

Katrin Geyer from the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom reviewed the number of adopted General Assembly First Committee Resolutions that included gender references over a five-year time span, from 2015 to 2019. The data gathered from the Reaching Critical Will First Committee Monitor publication of November 2019 and illustrated in the above graph, demonstrates a positive upward trend of gender perspectives being increasingly included in peace and security discussions and reflected in adopted resolutions. It is important to note that over the years some resolutions have adopted stronger language on gender, while others included references to gender for the first time.

## STATISTICS 2019

17 of the adopted resolutions in the UN General Assembly First Committee included gender references, accounting for 28% of all adopted resolutions.The resolutions addressed:

- women’s equal participation
- gendered impacts of weapon systems and armed violence
- need for gender considerations in disarmament machinery

Of the 17 adopted resolutions, four included language on gender for the first time. The four resolutions focused on:

- Biological Weapons Convention
- Youth
- Conventional Ammunition Stockpiles in Surplus
- Composition of the Group of Governmental Experts on Nuclear Disarmament Verification

## Nuclear Weapons and Gender

### NPT Review Process

2018 and 2019 PrepCom Chair Factual Summaries/Recommendations to the Review Conference:

- endorsed **equal, full and effective participation and leadership** of both women and men in nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy
- welcomed an **increase in female delegates**
- recognized the **disproportionate impact** of ionizing radiation on women and encouraged discussion in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) review process

At least three working papers submitted at the 2019 NPT PrepCom included gender references addressing the following topics:

- integration of **gender perspectives** in the implementation of the NPT
- improving **gender equality and diversity** in the review process
- incorporating gender in the NPT, including by applying a **gender analysis framework**, increasing gender diversity at all levels of representation, and recognizing the disproportionate impact of ionizing radiation on women and girls

### Ionized Radiation

Women are more vulnerable to the harmful effects of ionized radiation than men.

**Long Term:** women and girls have a higher risk of developing cancer than men or boys.

## Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons

- Cognizant of the disproportionate impact a nuclear weapons detonation has on women and girls – including ionized radiation but also in terms of socioeconomic development, food security and economy.
- Recognizes the need for equal, full and effective participation of both women and men in nuclear disarmament.
- Article 6: Victim Assistance

<Quote type="document" fullDocument="?" cite='Article 6: Vicitme Assistance, "Chance for Peace", speech to American Society of Newspaper Editors.'>

Each State Party shall, with respect to individuals under its jurisdiction who are affected by the use or testing of nuclear weapons (…) adequately provide age- and gender-sensitive assistance, without discrimination, including medical care, rehabilitation and psychological support, as well as provide for their social and economic inclusion.

## Percentage of Women and Men in Arms Control, Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Forums

Women continue to be **underrepresented** in disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation fora. The two figures to the right were provided by the UN Institute for Disarmament Research and are extracted from their report entitled “Still Behind the Curve: Gender Balance in Arms Control, Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Diplomacy”. The **first graph** highlights the percent of women represented in Geneva disarmament forums in the year 2018. In all fora for that year, women representation was below the baseline indicator of **36 percent**. The **second graph** highlights women representation in meetings relevant to the disarmament, arms control and disarmament field with more than 100 participants. The average female representation in such meetings is **32 percent**, which is below the average baseline and distant from gender parity aspirations.

For more information on the images and for further graphs on female representation in disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control fora, please read the UNIDIR “Still Behind the Curve” report from 2019.
