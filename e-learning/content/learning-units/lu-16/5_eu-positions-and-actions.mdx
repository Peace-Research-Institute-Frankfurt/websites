## Gender and Disarmament in the EU

<LectureVideo smil="lu16/lu16_vl5-1.smil" subtitles="https://nonproliferation-elearning.eu/learningunits/gender/vid/lu16_vl5-1.vtt" provider="video-stream">

Gender equality and respect for human rights are at the core of the European Union’s values. In 1997, under the Amsterdam Treaty, the European Union and its Member States endorsed gender mainstreaming as its official policy approach. The legal basis was strengthened under Article 8 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union that states:

In all its activities, the Union shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between men and women.

Since then, several subcommittees have been established to focus and monitor gender mainstreaming implementation in the EU’s policies and programmes. In addition, the European Commission has adopted guidelines and targets for addressing gender perspectives systematically across all areas of its work. These efforts cumulated into the adoption of the first EU Gender Action Plan in 2010 to better mainstream gender in all the Union’s policy areas. After the first five-year cycle, a second action plan was adopted in 2015, with renewed action plans anticipated every five years.

Since the adoption of UNSCR 1325, the EU and its Member States committed themselves to the full implementation of the Women, Peace and Security agenda, including in the full spectrum of the EU’s common foreign and security policy, or CFSP.

These commitments have been emphasized in the Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security, complimenting the first-ever adopted Conclusions on Women, Peace and Security in the Foreign Affairs Council in December 2018. Furthermore, the EU Global Strategy strives to increase the number of women in decision- and policy-making positions, as well as senior roles in EU institutions and Common Security and Defense Policy, or CSDP, missions and operations.

The promotion of increased participation of women in CSDP missions and operations is further guided by the EU’s commitment to consider the contribution of both men and women in all aspects of its crisis management work. To assist in these efforts, dedicated Gender Advisers and focal points are involved in CSDP missions and operations to facilitate gender mainstreaming, though the overall responsibility for integrating gender mainstreaming lies with the Heads of Mission and Commanders. The first gender advisor was appointed to the EUFOR RD Congo EU military operation in 2006. The operation aimed to support the UN Mission present in the country and to help facilitate elections. Though CSDP missions and operations work within the EU framework, it is important to note that policy and initiatives are mostly driven by Member States through National Action Plans.

In 2015 a dedicated position, the EEAS Principal Advisor on Gender and UNSCR 1325, was created to strengthen the WPS agenda in the EU CFSP. The creation of the position is an important step in promoting gender analysis, gender balance, and highlighting women’s leadership in all areas of peace and security, including in multilateral negotiations and processes dealing with arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament. In November 2018, the Council adopted a new Strategy against illicit Firearms, Small Arms and Light Weapons, or SALW, and their Ammunition, in which the EU committed to mainstreaming gender considerations in the design of new projects related to the fight against gun violence and SALW control, as well as sharing of good practices in this regard. Since the adoption of Council Decision (CFSP) 2018/2011, new projects integrate gender perspectives through technical advice and expertise, development of educational products and training. The UNODA is assisting in the implementation of the Council Decision by developing online-based training on gender mainstreaming small arms control for UN staff and other practitioners. The United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia Pacific in cooperation with the United Nations Development Program, South Eastern and Eastern Europe Clearinghouse for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons is also supporting the Council Decision through its Gender Coach Programme that pairs heads of SALW commissions with Gender Coaches to increase capacities in understanding linkages between gender and small arms. Given the EU’s strong commitment to gender mainstreaming, references in other disarmament documents and processes, such as the Arms Trade Treaty and Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention review process, are also noteworthy.

EU Task Force on WPS
The task force is a useful forum of exchange and partnership between the EU institutions, Member States and civil society. It was established in 2009 as an informal task force. In 2019 the name changed to EU Task Force on WPS. It meets four times a year:

- twice at the strategic level, which includes members of the EEAS and Presidency of the Council of the EU; and
- twice at the technical/working level.

### Political and Security Committee (PSC)

The PSC is a permanent body within the European Union and is responsible for the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). As such, the PSC is home to the WPS Agenda and EU’s implementation.
The body meets at the ambassadorial level and serves as a preparatory body for the Council of the EU.
Link to PSC: https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/preparatory-bodies/political-security-committee/

### EEAS Principal Advisor on Gender and UNSCR 1325

The position was established in 2015 to increase visibility and importance of gender issues within EU’s external policy and action as well as enhance EU engagement with international, regional and national actors on gender- and WPS-related policies and actions.
The EEAS Principal Advisor on Gender and UNSCR 1325 regularly reports to the PSC.
The position is currently held by Ambassador Mara Marinaki of Greece.

## European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE)

EIGE works within the framework of the EU policies and initiatives. It does not contribute to Common and Foreign Security Policy though. The Institute is however an integral actor in promoting equality between women and men across the European Union and offers expertise to the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Member States and Enlargement countries on gender.

### High-Level Group on Gender Equality and Diversity

The informal group is comprised of representatives responsible for gender mainstreaming at the national level and is chaired by the European Commission. The group holds regular meetings focusing on the EU gender equality agenda. It is also the main forum for planning follow-up of the Beijing Platform for Action inside the EU, including developing indicators. It also prepares the EU for the annual meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of Women.

## Case Study: EUFOR RD CONGO

Operation EUFOR RD Congo: mandated to support the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) during the national election process, both for President and Members of Parliament. The elections would enable the first democratic vote in 40 years.
For the first time the EU appointed a gender advisor to the operation with the task of sensitizing, training, monitoring and supporting officers and soldiers with different responsibilities.

Ms. Charlotte Isaksson, a gender expert in the Swedish Army, was appointed as gender advisor in 2006.

Ms. Isaksson also trained **multiplicators** – both women and men who could act as gender advisors and pass their knowledge and skills to others.

Gender Activities included

- observations
- planning
- direction and guidance on gender issues
- weekly gender report
- monthly statistics and information on female participants
- production of “soldier’s card” for troops on the ground containing clear instructions on gender issues, such as sexual abuse, and how to deal with child soldiers. The cards served as a framework for standard actions and behaviors to follow when confronted with different scenarios during the mission.

<Quote type="document" fullDocument="?" cite="Charlotte Isaksson">
  Most of the time women have not been asked for their views and perceptions. Yet, if you are to integrate a gender dimension into any activity, you
  have to assess the different impact those activities might have on women and men and in order to do that, it is a paramount to collect as much first
  hand information as possible.

## Gender Coach Programme on SALW

The video provided by the United Nations Development Programme and the South Eastern and Eastern Europe Clearninghouse for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SEESAC) highlights facts and figures that exemplify the gender differences in small arms and light weapons (SALW) when it comes to ownership and misuse of firearms.

It also focuses on work being done by the Gender Coach Programme, which was launched in 2017, to promote the inclusion of gender in SALW control policies and best practices. Please note that the video does not include narration.

### The programme

1. increases capacities of SALW Commissions to mainstream gender in SALW control
2. improves access to sex-disaggregated data
3. increases knowledge and expertise on gender aspects of SALW
4. increases participation of women in SALW control policy making

The work is supported and funded by the EU:

- EU Council Decision (CFSP) 2018/1788 of 19 November 2018
- EU Council Decision (CFSP) 2018/2011 of 17 December 2018

## Women in Civilian CSDP Missions

Between 2007 and 2013 there was an increase in women participation in Common Security and Defense Policy, or CSDP, missions. Overall, the proportion of women rose from 20% to 26% and the absolute number of female civil personnel in CSDP missions increased from 240 to 869.
However, most personnel appointments are made through national secondments – meaning Member States’ individual efforts in achieving gender balance and collecting gender-disaggregated data is as important as EU-wide policies and commitments.
