## Learning objectives

The learning unit provides a comprehensive overview of space security, emphasising its indispensable role in modern life and the evolving landscape of space governance. It outlines the diverse risks to space operations, including space weather, debris, interference and intentional threats such as counterspace capabilities and hybrid operations. The importance of Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and Space Domain Awareness (SDA) for monitoring and managing space activities is highlighted. It also features considerations on space governance frameworks and the EU’s role in promoting responsible behaviour. The unit also delves into the emerging competition in space partnerships, exemplified by the Artemis Program and the joint endeavours pursued by China and Russia, underscoring the geopolitical tensions and the need for collaborative efforts to ensure the peaceful and sustainable use of outer space.
