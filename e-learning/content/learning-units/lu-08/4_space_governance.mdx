## Space governance
The history of space law goes back to the beginning of the space age in the 1950s, when the United Nations, after the launch of Sputnik in 1957, decided, in 1959, to establish the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, also referred to as (<Term t="UN COPUOS"/>). Another essential international body related to <Term t="space governance"/> and arms control is the Conference of Disarmament (CD), formed in 1979. The CD is a multilateral disarmament negotiation forum, financed from the UN budget, which reports to the UN General Assembly and considers its proposals and recommendations. [^55]
The UN laid the groundwork for the main principles governing outer space activities in the form of five space treaties, five sets of principles on space-related activities [^56] and various UN resolutions.

The five space treaties are:
*	The Outer Space Treaty (1967)
*	The Rescue Agreement (1968)
*	The Liability Convention (1972)
*	The Registration Convention (1975)
*	The Moon Agreement (1979)

The five sets of principles on space-related activities are:
*	The ‘Declaration of Legal Principles’ (1963)
*	The ‘Broadcasting Principles’ (1982)
*	The ‘Remote Sensing Principles’ (1986)
*	The ‘Nuclear Power Sources Principles’ (1992)
*	The ‘Benefits Declaration’ (1996)

The ‘Magna Carta’ of space law is the **UN Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies** (the so-called Outer Space Treaty or <Term t="OST"/>). The Outer Space Treaty institutionalised the framework for outer space activities.

The Treaty entered into force in 1967 during the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union and security was a key element. Its purpose was to prevent space from becoming another area of conflict. This is why, for example, the Treaty established the concepts of non-appropriation of outer space, the freedom of exploration, the prevention of harmful interference with space activities and the environment, as well as principles of peaceful cooperation and scientific exploration.

The Outer Space Treaty banned the ‘placement of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction’ in space and emphasised that space is only to be used for ‘peaceful purposes’. However, the Treaty only bans the placement of nuclear weapons in space, not their development and testing (though testing was banned by the 1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space, and Under Water). Nor does the Outer Space Treaty specifically prohibit the use of nuclear ballistic missiles travelling through space due to its focus on preventing the placement of nuclear weapons in orbit or on celestial bodies. Since the Treaty was negotiated during the Cold War era when nuclear deterrence strategies were prevalent, achieving consensus on a complete ban on nuclear weapons in space proved challenging. Moreover, the Treaty does not ban the placement of conventional weapons, such as co-orbital mines, in space, nor does it address ballistic missiles – nuclear equipped or not – that ascent to and move through space. As the last space treaty – the Moon Treaty – was signed as long ago as 1979, there are concerns about whether this body of law, developed during the Cold War, is sufficient to address the much more complex situations in space today

As negotiating amendments to the Outer Space Treaty or signing a new Treaty would possibly be a decades-long process, countries have engaged in various other initiatives to strengthen space governance. Some countries, such as Russia and China, promote the concept of ‘arms control for space’ whereas others, such as European countries and the United States, lean towards responsible norms of behaviour in outer space-related initiatives. Due to the inherent dual-use nature of space technologies, arms control proposals for space are problematic, mainly because of the issue of verification.

### The Hague Code of Conduct
The Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation (<Term t="HCoC"/>) is a set of voluntary norms seeking to address missile proliferation. Given the similarities between the technologies used in ballistic missiles and civilian rockets, the Hague Code also introduces transparency measures such as annual declarations and pre-launch notifications regarding ballistic missile and space launch programs. The HCoC also states that ‘Space Launch Vehicle programs should not be used to conceal Ballistic Missile programs’. [^57]  The HCoC was signed and entered into force in 2002 in the Hague (Netherlands). As of June 2023, a total of 143 nations had joined the HCoC (141 United Nations members, the Cook Islands and the Holy See). [^58] However, the Hague Code of Conduct does not contain an effective verification and compliance mechanism. It also faces issues related to non-compliance.

### Guidelines for the Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities
Between 2010 and 2018, the UN COPUOS working group negotiated what are known as Guidelines for the Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities (<Term t="LTS Guidelines"/>). In June 2018, a total of 21 guidelines were adopted. The UN COPUOS guidelines are not legally binding. However, the states who have adopted the guidelines are responsible for the security and safety of space activities and may implement these rules into national legislation. Such steps are crucial, not only for states themselves but also for commercial and other non-state actors. Although the adoption of 21 guidelines was considered a substantive success, space activities are rapidly evolving, and the rules that were negotiated arguably do not sufficiently reflect the dynamic development of the space sector. Instead, they should be seen as the groundwork for developing a new set of guidelines, the LTS 2.0, in the near future.

### Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space and of the Threat or Use of Force Against Outer Space Objects
Prevention of an arms race in space (PAROS) has been on the agenda since 1985. A draft Treaty on the Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space and of the Threat or Use of Force Against Outer Space Objects (<Term t="PPWT"/>)  was first proposed by China and Russia in 2008, and a revised version in 2014. In 2004, Russia pledged at the UN General Assembly First Committee ‘not to be the first to place weapons of any kind in outer space’. However, the draft treaty was opposed by the United States due to its significant flaws. The PPWT, for instance, does not address direct ascent kinetic anti-satellite weapons, nor does it propose efficient verification mechanisms or exact definitions. Moreover, Russia irresponsibly tested a direct ascent kinetic anti-satellite weapon in 2021 and recently demonstrated advanced orbital operations that could relate to the testing of co-orbital anti-satellite weapons.

### Reducing space threats through norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors
Due to the verification issues created by the dual-use nature of space technology and weapons, the alternative approach to the arms control of outer space is a gradual implementation of new norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour that can create the foundation for viable legally binding arms control treaties in the future. The most notable initiative in this regard, building on the European Code of Conduct from 2012, is the ‘Reducing space threats through norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors’ resolution that was first adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2020. As part of this resolution, an open-ended working group (OEWG) has been established with the goal of making recommendations to the General Assembly. This norm-oriented resolution endorses a ‘bottom-up’ approach to space arms control and is widely supported by democratic states. However, countries like Russia and China are opposed to such initiatives and are stalling the process.

### Destructive direct ascent anti-satellite missile testing
In April 2022, the United States declared a self-imposed ban on direct ascent destructive anti-satellite weapons tests, further promoting new norms for responsible behaviour in outer space. As of July 2023, a total of 14 nations had joined this commitment, including, alongside the United States, Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea, Switzerland, Lithuania and the United Kingdom. In December 2022, the UN General Assembly approved a ‘Destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite missile testing’ resolution that ‘calls upon all States to commit not to conduct destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite missile tests’. [^59] A total of 155 nations voted in favour of the resolution. However, nine countries, including Russia and China, opposed it. Moreover, UN resolutions are not legally binding. It would therefore be welcomed if more nations were to make official commitments to this international norm, which would reinforce space arms control and peaceful uses of outer space.

## Conclusion
The governance of outer space, established through UN bodies and treaties such as the Outer Space Treaty, aimed to prevent space from becoming a battleground. However, challenges persist due to evolving technologies as well as disagreements among nations. Efforts to address the situation include arms control proposals and promoting responsible behaviour in space activities. Despite initiatives such as self-imposed bans on certain types of testing, global alignment on these commitments remains a challenge. Strengthening space governance requires updated frameworks that take technological advancements into account while fostering international cooperation for peaceful space exploration.
