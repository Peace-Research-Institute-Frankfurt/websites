  Outer space extends beyond the realms of celestial bodies and their atmospheres. For those observing from Earth, space is commonly considered to commence approximately 100 kilometres above sea level, known as the Kármán line. This conceptual boundary marks an altitude where the presence of air becomes negligible, devoid of enough density for breathing or scattering light.[^1]

  Security concerns have accompanied space activities since their inception in the 1950s, with the successful launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union being widely seen as the start of the space age. The effective functioning of space assets for observation, early warning, navigation/timing, communications and an array of other security-related capabilities has proven essential to the preservation of international stability. Today, space is a global enabler with applications that have a profound impact on the daily lives of people and the prosperity of nations. Space has evolved from being an exclusively governmental domain to one that has embraced the private sector, including commercial satellite and launch owners/operators.

  Space capabilities are indispensable for most aspects of modern life, providing services such as synchronisation of financial transactions, enabling transportation, providing weather forecasting, supporting smartphones and offering entertainment services. In short, satellite-based applications are fundamental to the day-to-day lives of an increasing number of people and are becoming an integral part of the global data infrastructure.

  According to ESA there are currently around 9,000 operational satellites in orbit[^2], owned by more than 80 countries[^3],  and the number is constantly growing.

  Space security involves a wide spectrum of topics, including safeguarding space assets and ground segments against a threat or disruption that could have significant implications for national security, defence and civilian applications, as well as normative aspects of responsible behaviour and international treaties governing space operations.

  Space security encompasses:
  - secure access to and use of space;
  - security on Earth from threats originating in space.

  Space threats emanate from:
  - natural hazards (e.g. space weather); technical mishaps (e.g. unintentional interference); and intentional actions;
  - counterspace activities involving the development of multifaceted capabilities that could be used to disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy space systems.

  Although the unit primarily focuses on space security, it is essential to underscore the nuanced but critical distinction between this and the concept of space safety. While space security predominantly addresses the safeguarding of space assets against deliberate threats and ensuring the resilience of space operations, space safety pertains more specifically to the establishment and maintenance of protocols and agreements governing safe interaction between human actors operating in the space domain.

  To understand the intricate realm of space and its attendant security concerns, a comprehensive analysis of divergent viewpoints is indispensable. This necessitates a deep dive into the multifaceted dimensions of these different positions, encompassing commercial, military and multilateral outlooks.

## Space commercialisation

The first use of space goes back to the early Cold War. This was an era dominated by the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, placing national security space at the forefront of space activities.

<Figure

  license=""
></Figure>

The progressive development throughout the Cold War era showed that space technologies are inherently dual use. Moreover, space development has become a strategic and prestigious endeavour for powerful countries.[^4]

As the Cold War ended, new opportunities arose for both military and civil collaboration, also demonstrating the benefits of public–private partnerships (PPPs). This has gradually led to the emergence of new space actors, both government and private.[^5]

Historically, space activities were focused on big, time-consuming and very expensive projects, such as the James Webb telescope.

<Figure

></Figure>

In recent years, with the entrance of the private sector and smaller countries that cannot afford such huge undertakings or investment risks, projects are less time-consuming and R&D-intensive, with a shorter duration of missions and fixed prices. This shift was enabled by the miniaturisation of satellites – CubeSats, which offer a cheap way of trying out a new technology, as well as cheaper access to space due to reusable launchers. These factors allow for more rapid technological demonstration in orbit rather than in the lab.[^6]

In the US, private investors, such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson, have boosted interest in commercial space opportunities on the part of venture capital and private equity investors, now seemingly more willing to absorb the sizable risks related to space activities. Europe has adopted a number of measures to support new investment in start-ups, as well as early and mature space companies (e.g. via the European Investment Fund, the European Space Fund, etc.).

## The military perspective on space security

<LectureVideo smil="/lu08/HSFK-PC_LU08-CH02_12b_250109.smil" provider="video-stream">

  The space domain holds significant importance for military operations due to various critical functions, offering an array of indispensable functionalities that underpin modern warfare. This strategic evolution, formally acknowledged by NATO in December 2019 through its recognition of space as an operational domain, underscores the integral role of space in joint military activities among allies and beyond.[^7]

  <Quote fullDocument=": https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_171584.htm" cite='London Declaration, Issued by the Heads of State and Government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in London 3-4 December 2019'>
    …NATO and Allies, within their respective authority, are committed to ensuring the security of our communications, including 5G, recognising the need to rely on secure and resilient systems.  We have declared space an operational domain for NATO, recognising its importance in keeping us safe and tackling security challenges, while upholding international law…
  </Quote>

  Satellites orbiting the Earth serve as the linchpin for global communication and navigation systems, forming the backbone of secure and reliable military communications. These satellites enable precision navigation during operations, providing essential support for troop movements, logistical coordination and strategic deployment.

  The advanced sensing technologies that space-based assets are equipped with play a pivotal role in surveillance and intelligence gathering. These capabilities provide real-time, high-resolution imagery, facilitating military situational awareness. Information derived from space-based sensors aids in threat detection, intelligence gathering and strategic decision-making, offering a substantial advantage in planning and executing military operations. The significance of space in missile warning systems cannot be overstated.[^8] Infrared sensors positioned in space can detect and track missile launches across the globe. Early warning systems, predominantly based in space, enable swift responses and effective counter-measures against missile threats, ensuring rapid reaction in critical moments.[^9]

  Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), primarily composed of satellites in space, are indispensable for precise positioning, navigation and timing. Military operations, including the functioning of precision-guided weapons and logistical coordination, rely heavily on the accurate data provided by these satellites. The synchronisation and coordination enabled by GNSS serve as a force multiplier, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of military forces on the ground and in the air. Moreover, technologies such as reconnaissance satellites, weather monitoring systems and communication satellites contribute significantly to better-informed decision-making and the coordination of military operations in various terrains and scenarios.

  The dual-use nature of space technology, originally developed for civilian purposes but adopted and adapted for military use, reflects the evolution of space as a vital theatre for both civilian and military endeavours. This duality fuels the interest in countering potential threats in space and emphasises the establishment of dedicated space forces and robust counter-measures to safeguard national security interests in this increasingly contested and vital domain.

## Multilateral cooperation in the space realm
<LectureVideo smil="/lu08/HSFK-PC_LU08-CH03_12b_250109.smil" provider="video-stream">
  The multilateral dimension of space activities underscores the collaborative and cooperative efforts between nations in the exploration and utilisation of outer space. In an era marked by increasing international participation in space missions and growing reliance on space-based technologies, the importance of multilateral cooperation cannot be emphasised enough. This dimension encompasses a wide range of activities, from jointly planned and executed space missions to the sharing of scientific data, technology transfer and the establishment of international agreements to ensure the responsible and peaceful use of space

  Some countries seek to capitalise on the benefits of space by operating their own satellites (e.g. Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, Australia, Taiwan, South Africa, Mexico, Vietnam, Egypt, etc.), and some – not having indigenous space capabilities – are seeking to derive space-based benefits (e.g. many African countries). Countries with limited or no capabilities have often sought partnerships with China and/or Russia in the development of their space sectors, even if they are Western allies.[^10]

  To achieve their strategic goals, however, China and Russia repeatedly circumvent or even violate internationally negotiated norms. China has frequently been accused of industrial espionage[^11], intellectual property theft[^12] and heavily subsidised pricing, which are often a function of Chinese non-transparent ownership structures and unfair business practices.[^13] As mentioned above, the construction of space infrastructure and proliferation of related technologies, equipment and services to other countries is a substantive part of both China’s and Russia’s strategic initiatives in space.

  Further, questions regarding space security are discussed in the UN General Assembly’s Disarmament and International Security Committee (First Committee)[^14] and the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee).[^15] The First Committee works closely with the UN Disarmament Commission, while the Fourth oversees the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.[^16]

Moreover, there is a growing number of nations actively participating in space activities. Space has become a realm of strategic interest for many countries, with an emphasis on national security, intelligence gathering and communication networks. The dual-use nature of space technologies further emphasises the necessity of safeguarding these assets, highlighting the emergence of dedicated space forces and the need for protective measures to secure national interests in this critical domain. The expansion of space capabilities and the increasing number of actors involved create both opportunities and challenges in terms of international cooperation, governance and potential conflicts.
