## The EU and space
The EU believes that without active diplomacy, incidents and even conflicts involving the space domain are inevitable. In 2008, the EU proposed an <Term t="International Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities"/> and, between 2012 and 2015, held extensive consultations with many UN nations. However, apart from European countries and other ‘like-minded’ partners, it did not gather sufficient support and therefore had no concrete outcome.
In 2019, the EU launched the ‘Safety, Security and Sustainability of Outer Space’ (3SOS) public diplomacy initiative promoted by the European External Action Service (EEAS). This non-treaty-based effort to advance space security sidesteps the daunting task of defining space weapons or advocating a certain brand of arms control.
The 2016 EU Global Strategy confirmed that it plans to promote the security of its space-based services and work on principles for responsible space behaviour. The 2022 EU Strategic Compass identified space as a strategic domain and called for developing an EU Space Strategy for Security and Defence (EU SSSD), which was then adopted in 2023. The EU Space Strategy endorses engagement in multilateral fora and the promotion of norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours in outer space.

The five main pillars of the strategy are: [^60]
*	ensuring a shared understanding of space threats;
*	enhancing the resilience and protection of space systems and services in the EU;
*	strengthening the collective ability of the EU to respond to any attacks and threats putting at risk the EU’s security interests;
*	developing dual-use space capabilities, including for security and defence purposes; and
*	fostering global partnerships.

The EU SSSD also encourages dialogue with third countries, in particular with the United States and other like-minded nations, including strengthening the EU’s cooperation with NATO.[^61] The latter recognised space as a new operational domain in 2019 and, in 2022, admitted that attacks to, from or within space present a clear challenge to the security of the Alliance and could lead to the invocation of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.

### EU Space Programme
In 2021, the EU Space Programme was implemented, establishing the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) in Prague, replacing and expanding the former European Agency for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GSA). The new programme expands the role of EUSPA, adding two new components – management of the exploitation of <Term t="Galileo"/> and <Term t="EGNOS"/>. Most importantly, EUSPA became responsible for the security accreditation of all the components of the EU Space Programme. [^63]

The five main components of the EU Space Programme [^64] are:
*	Galileo: Navigation (GNSS)
*	EGNOS: Navigation (GNSS)
*	<Term t="Copernicus"/>: Remote sensing (Earth observation)
*	<Term t="GOVSATCOM"/>: Secure communication
*	SSA: Space Situational Awareness

## Conclusion
The European Union (EU) has actively pursued initiatives to address space security challenges and governance. Despite some setbacks in gaining broad support for specific proposals such as the International Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities, the EU remains committed to ensuring the safety, security and sustainability of space activities. Through efforts such as the ‘Safety, Security and Sustainability of Outer Space’ (<Term t="3SOS"/>) initiative and the EU Space Strategy for Security and Defence (EU SSSD), the EU aims to enhance shared understanding of space threats, fortify the resilience of space systems, develop collective response capabilities and foster global partnerships. Engaging in dialogue with entities such as the United States and NATO, the EU emphasises collaborative efforts to address space security. The establishment of the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) under the EU Space Programme points to an expansion of the EU’s role in navigation, remote sensing, secure communication and Space Situational Awareness.
