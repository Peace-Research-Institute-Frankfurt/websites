## Definition, trade and illicit proliferation of SALW
Small arms and light weapons (SALW) are the weapons of choice of many non-state actors, ranging from criminals to rebel groups and terrorists. These weapons are highly lethal instruments of violence and generally easy to use. As a result, SALW are frequently used in various acts of violence across the globe. The illicit proliferation of these weapons can cause an increase in human rights violations and pose a serious threat to peace and security.

Most SALW are initially legally produced and transferred across the globe. However, at any point during their life cycle, they can be diverted into the illegal domain, making it particularly challenging to address their proliferation. Due to the fact that they are light to carry, transfer and maintain, these weapons are easy to smuggle and traffic. Effectively combating the illicit proliferation of SALW requires regional and international cooperation between different actors, as well as more effective SALW export control policies.

In this learning unit, we will discuss the definition, trade and illicit proliferation of SALW, as well as international and regional policy responses. Special emphasis will be placed on the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) and the EU policies developed to combat the illicit proliferation of SALW. Given the immense risk of illicit SALW, we will conclude with the challenges and opportunities ahead.

Since the mid-1990s, the idea that the proliferation of small arms and light weapons sustains
and exacerbates armed conflicts, and especially intra-state conflicts, has led to the
development of a number of international and regional policy instruments aimed at
strengthening the national regulation of these weapons. Yet, despite this increasing policy
attention, there is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes “small arms and light
weapons”.

The UN Panel of Governmental Experts in 1997 defined small arms as “those weapons
designed for personal use” and includes different types of firearms such as pistols, revolvers,
assault rifles and light machine guns. In this learning unit, we will use terms such as “small
arms”, “firearms” and “guns” interchangeably.

Light weapons, on the other hand, are described as weapons “designed for use by several
persons serving as a crew” such as man-portable heavy machine guns, which are typically
mounted on vehicles, or man-held RPGs (which are rocket-propelled grenade anti-tank
weapons) or MANPADs (which are shoulder-launched man-portable air defence systems that
can target low-flying airplanes and helicopters).

According to Armament Research Services (ARES)[^1],  small arms are firearms not exceeding 20 mm calibre, used by the military, security institutions and civilians. Similar to the above definition of light weapons, ARES defines them as portable weapons that can be carried and operated on foot by no more than five individuals. They are more commonly used by the military than civilians or the police.

All these definitions are used to enhance knowledge about and facilitate an understanding of the distinction between small arms and light weapons.

Apart from defining them, it is also important to identify and recognise different weapons that fall under the category of small arms, light weapons and their ammunition.


#### Identifying small arms

*	**Pistols**, commonly referred to as handguns, are small arms which can be fired single-handed (see Figure 1). They are widely accessible and are the weapons most frequently used in illegal activities.
*	**Revolvers** consist of single-handed small arms with bullets in a rotating cylinder above the trigger (see Figure 2).
*	**Rifles and carbines** are long firearms. Automatic versions of these weapons only require one pull of the trigger to release a burst of bullets. The most commonly known assault rifle is the Kalashnikov AK-47 (see Figure 3).
*	**Machine guns** are automatic long firearms capable of sustaining a high rate of fire.
    * Submachine guns are a hybrid between pistols and assault rifles and are relatively easy to operate.
    * Light machine guns can fire in “rapid bursts to extended ranges”.[^2]

#### Identifying light weapons

*	**Heavy machine guns** are belt-fed weapons that fire at high rates, supported by a tripod for stability.
*	**Man-portable air defence systems (MANPADS)** are shoulder-launched  systems that can target low-flying airplanes, helicopters and drones (see Figure 5).
*	**Portable launchers of rocket systems** are used to destroy armour and fortifications with a guided missile (see Figure 6).
*	**Mortars of calibres less than 100 mm** are support weapons that can be used against targets out of sight.

#### Identifying SALW ammunition and explosives
*	**Cartridges** for small arms are casings containing the explosive to propel the bullet (see Figure 7).
*	**Shells and missiles** for light weapons consist of projectiles containing the explosive fired out of the light weapons (see Figure 8).
*	**Anti-personnel and anti-tank grenades** are munitions thrown by an individual that are effective against personnel and tanks.

## Production and transfer of SALW
The production and trade of small arms and light weapons is a multi-billion dollar business, employing tens of thousands of people. In 2017, the financial **value of authorised transfers** of small arms and light weapons globally was estimated to be **at least 6.5 billion dollars**.[^3]

Research has shown that **worldwide**, in excess of **a thousand companies** from more than **90 countries** are involved in some aspect of the production of small arms and light weapons. The companies engaged in the business are very diverse, ranging from small family-owned businesses to subsidiaries of large multinationals to state-owned companies.

As of 2017, the biggest small arms and light weapons exporters in the world were the **United States**, followed by **Italy and Brazil**. A number of European countries, such as **Austria, Belgium, Germany and Spain**, are traditionally also significant exporters of these types of weapons. Unfortunately, more recent reliable global figures on small arms and light weapons exporters are not available.

In recent decades, producers from countries such as **China, Brazil, Turkey, Israel and South Korea** have been challenging the established US and European businesses. This has often been the result of licensed production. Pretty much all of the largest firearms producers have production licensing agreements with several manufacturers abroad. Every year, more than 500,000 firearms are produced under license or as unlicensed copies.

In 2017, the top four exporting countries exported small arms worth 2.8 billion US dollars (see Table 1).
*	Top exporters include countries “trading at least USD 100 million worth of SALW”.[^4]

In the same year, 21 major exporters accumulated 946 million US dollars worth of small arms export (see Table 1).
*	Major exporters comprise countries “trading at least USD 10 million worth of SALW”.[^5]

Ammunition for small arms is produced in more than 100 countries worldwide and comprises the largest category of small arms exports.

Globally, the production of ammunition is unbalanced. Only a limited number of countries are capable of producing significant amounts of ammunition of a consistently high quality. Specifically, 15 countries are responsible for about 90 percent of all international ammunition transfers.

## The illicit proliferation of SALW
Given that they are portable and easy to use, SALW are employed by civilians, police and the military. Civilians can acquire SALW legally, but they are also widely available and accessible illegally, which means there is a potential risk of them being used by criminal gangs. While official armed and police forces can legally purchase small arms and light weapons from the international defence market, this is generally not the case for non-state actors, such as rebel groups and terrorists. As a result, access to illicit SALW poses a serious threat to peace and security. These are the key aspects covered in the following section.

### Why are SALW so widespread?

Some of the distinguishing features of small arms and light weapons make them very suitable for contemporary armed conflict, and especially for non-state actors. First of all, small arms and light weapons – and especially military-style weapons such as assault rifles, machine guns or rocket launchers – are very lethal instruments. They provide non-state actors with a boost in firepower, often matching or exceeding the firepower of national police or armed forces and this significantly increases their chance of success. These weapons are also easy to use and to maintain. They generally require little maintenance and little training, which makes them particularly suitable for conflicts that involve untrained fighters. Small arms and light weapons can also easily be transported since they can be carried by an individual fighter or in a light vehicle. They can also be efficiently concealed and therefore easily trafficked. In addition, most small arms and light weapons are durable goods that remain operational for many years, often even many decades. While new types of small arms and light weapons are constantly produced, the older and cheapest versions of these weapons tend to be the most widespread in contemporary conflicts in which non-state actors are involved. Many of the small arms and light weapons used in conflicts today have been circulating between conflict zones for many years now, and in many parts of the world, sophisticated second-hand small arms and light weapons are readily available, many of which were produced and originally transferred during the Cold War. The availability of large quantities of these weapons in conflict zones results in relatively low prices. Although a great variation in prices can be found, even across geographically close regions, small arms and light weapons are generally cheaper than larger conventional weapons.

While most official armed forces and police forces can legally buy small arms and light weapons from the international defence market, this is generally not the case for non-state actors such as rebel and terrorist groups. These groups have to rely on illicit acquisition methods to arm themselves. It is sometimes estimated that the size of illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons accounts for 10–20 percent of the legal trade in these weapons, but this figure needs to be interpreted with great caution. While much work has been done in quantifying authorised transfers of small arms and light weapons, research on arms acquisition by rebel groups or terrorists is much more difficult to quantify and relies heavily on case studies and anecdotal evidence.

There are different methods that can be used by non-state actors to illicitly acquire these weapons. The overwhelming majority of illicitly transferred small arms and light weapons were produced legally, but were diverted at a certain point in their life cycle, for example when they were stolen from production sites, government stockpiles or legal gun owners. Especially government arms stockpiles are often attractive sources of small arms and light weapons for non-state actors. Securing these government stockpiles by safeguarding against individual loss, pilferage, small-scale theft or even the seizure of entire stockpiles is therefore a major challenge in many countries.

Another important source of small arms and light weapons are battlefield recoveries where weapons are taken from defeated opponents.

A large number of non-state actors also rely on the patronage of foreign governments for the acquisition of their weapons. The Cold War can be considered the heyday for these grey market transfers, with the major powers openly or covertly supporting their proxies worldwide by supplying them with weapons or the financial means to purchase them. After the end of the Cold War, this military support was largely “regionalised” with regional powers providing weapons to their proxies, mostly in neighbouring countries.

Non-state actors can also turn to the black market for the acquisition of small arms and light weapons. This black market often operates on a regional level with criminals, rebel groups and opportunistic individuals transferring weapons from one conflict zone to another.

The proliferation of small arms and light weapons is generally considered a serious threat to peace, security, human rights and sustainable development. The availability of these weapons is closely connected to conflict dynamics. The access to weapons facilitates engaging in armed combat. In addition, the availability of large quantities of especially military-style weapons can strongly intensify existing conflicts. Even when the armed conflict is resolved, the continued presence of the weapons in the hands of private citizens in post-conflict zones entails the risk of a quick return to violence since the availability of these weapons may threaten legitimate but weak governments and fuel criminal and terrorist activities.

### The gendered aspect of SALW
The possession, use and misuse of SALW, as well as attitudes towards these types of weapons, are highly gendered. The violence committed using SALW affects women, men and other genders differently.
More than half a million homicides occur worldwide due to armed conflict or armed violence, with men accounting for around 84 percent and women for less than 16 percent of the victims (UN, 2017). Young men aged 15–29 comprise the largest group targtedtargeted by small arms violence and violent deaths. They also represent the largest demographic group likely to use small arms in committing a crime. Moreover, according to the UN, “most of the world’s estimated 875 million small arms are in male hands”. Women on the other hand are more likely to consider small arms a threat to safety.
Women and girls worldwide are disproportionally affected by SALW proliferation, as SALW can be used to facilitate gender-based violence (GBV), intimate partner violence and sexual violence in conflict settings. One-third of all killings of women and girls worldwide are committed with SALW. Not only is there a risk of SALW being used to kill but also to instil fear and intimidation among women and LGBTQ+ people.
The policy response has improved over time in terms of recognising the relationship between SALW and GBV in international legally binding instruments.
