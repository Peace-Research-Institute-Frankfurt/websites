## Recent developments and new challenges

Especially in the aftermath of armed conflict, the availability of and access to weapons can greatly intensify existing conflicts. When armed conflict ends, citizens often experience insecurity, especially as the rule of law and security sector institutions are in the process of being (re-)established and trust in institutions is usually absent. Consequently, citizens often acquire or retain small arms for self-defence in anticipation of potential violence, an action which itself may lead to a rapid return to violence, as well as fuelling criminal and terrorist activities. Thus, establishing effective control over small arms (including stockpiles) in post-conflict settings is crucial for fostering peace and security in these contexts and beyond.

Considerable progress has been made since the issue of small arms and light weapons appeared on the international community’s agenda in the 1990s. The adoption and implementation of several regional agreements represent significant advancements. At the UN level, a number of important instruments, such as the Firearms Protocol, the UN Programme of Action and the Arms Trade Treaty, have been developed to address the proliferation of small arms and light weapons. The basic idea behind these international initiatives is to stop deadly weapons ending up in the wrong hands. Initially, these instruments mainly focused on combatting the illicit manufacturing and trafficking of small arms and light weapons in an
attempt to prevent non-state actors, such as insurgents, rebel groups, terrorists or criminals,
from accessing these weapons. Less international policy attention has traditionally been given to preventing authorised transfers of small arms and light weapons that might have negative humanitarian consequences in the recipient country.
 While much progress has been made in recent decades, there is still a long way to go. In 2000, when international policy attention was beginning to shift to the uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons, the UN identified a number of important obstacles: the lack of capacity by some states, the irresponsible behaviour of others, and the shroud of secrecy that veils much of the arms trade. Today, these obstacles can still be considered significant challenges for effective humanitarian arms control.

First of all, some countries lack the capacity to implement legislation and agreements
effectively. In order to have a significant impact, it is important to go beyond just another set of commitments on paper. Often, however, conflict-prone countries in particular do not possess the financial and administrative resources needed to implement international and national instruments aimed at controlling the undesired proliferation of small arms and light weapons. For these countries, controlling their territorial borders, marking and tracing weapons, implementing effective stockpile management programmes, and detecting and seizing illicitly transferred weapons frequently proves to be problematic. Yet, even in high-income countries that have not experienced armed conflict, capacity problems have been identified, often due to the fact that tackling the issue of SALW proliferation has not been made a political priority.

Capacity problems have been exacerbated by a number of recent technological developments in the design and manufacturing of firearms, such as the increased use of polymers to produce
firearm frames and receivers. In the last few years, 3D printing of firearms has also become much more of a problem. Ranging from basic models to more sophisticated ones, 3D-printed small arms can be produced relatively cheaply and, because these weapons do not have serial numbers, they are currently almost impossible to trace (and are therefore often referred to as “ghost guns”). New technological developments thus make it easier to bypass state controls on firearms. At the same time, technological developments can also provide new and better options for the control of small arms and light weapons with regard to, for example, the marking and record-keeping of these weapons, better stockpile management possibilities and more opportunities to prevent the unauthorised use of these weapons. A wide range of available technologies have been identified as potentially relevant for preventing diversion of SALW. They also enable stakeholders to set up early warning mechanisms, as well as enhance transparency, cooperation and trust.[^6] Technology can also contribute to strengthening data collection and data analysis, particularly artificial intelligence (AI).

Another serious challenge is the lack of good data. Research based on reliable data can support evidence-based policy, while a good intelligence picture is needed for effective law enforcement actions to counter the trafficking of SALW. Yet, reliable, comprehensive and detailed data on seizures of SALW is lacking in most countries across the world. As a result, the intelligence picture on the trafficking of these weapons is inadequate. Moreover, much of the research on arms acquisition by non-state actors relies heavily on case studies and anecdotal evidence rather than hard data. This hampers the development and improvement of effective and efficient policy instruments.

A final key challenge here is the irresponsible behaviour of some states. While an overwhelming majority of countries voted in favour of the Arms Trade Treaty and many states have already signed and ratified the Treaty, other countries have not done so, including some of the largest arms exporters in the world. It is vital that the challenge of universalising the ATT is addressed in order to achieve its objectives. Yet, equally challenging is the actual implementation of the Treaty. Having a strong document is one thing, implementing it is something else. Experience in the EU has shown that despite the adoption of ethical norms, economic and geopolitical interests may jeopardise responsible behaviour of states. While the EU has adopted one of the most developed arms export control systems in the world, several EU member states continue to authorise the export of SALW to countries engaged in armed conflict and to conflict-prone regions.

The uncontrolled proliferation of small arms and light weapons is globally acknowledged as a serious threat to peace, security and sustainable development. In recent decades, many international, EU and regional instruments were developed to prevent these very lethal weapons ending up in the wrong hands. We can conclude that while much progress has been made in some areas, a number of key challenges remain and these need to be dealt with in order to tackle the uncontrolled proliferation of small arms and light weapons and contribute to a more peaceful global society.
