## Negotiating the ATT
The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) is the result of almost 20 years of diplomacy and advocacy. Early initiatives to draft an international arms trade treaty date back to **1997** when former Nobel Prize laureates sat together and drafted an International Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers.

Based on this Code of Conduct, a Draft Framework Convention on International Arms Transfers was first circulated at the **2001** UN Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) Conference. The document called for a universal, legally binding agreement governing arms transfers.

The UN Resolution that launched the process to develop the Arms Trade Treaty was initiated by the United Kingdom, Australia, Argentina, Costa Rica, Finland, Kenya and Japan in **2006**.

In **2009**, the UN adopted **Resolution 64/48** – to convene a UN Conference on the ATT in 2012.

During the negotiations in **July 2012**, diplomats could not agree on a text that was acceptable to all. Several UN member states, including the United States, demanded extra time to agree on a draft text. The main points of disagreement involved the scope of the treaty (e.g. inclusion of ammunition), assessment criteria (e.g. emphasis on human rights), the right to obtain weapons for importing states, whether or not to prohibit exports to non-state actors, other procedural issues such as member states’ fear of their exports being restricted, and access to arms flows being limited by international law.

In April 2013, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the Arms Trade Treaty, the first global instrument regulating the international trade in conventional arms. Unlike chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, trade in conventional weapons was not regulated on a global level before.

NGOs and coalitions of willing states, including the European Union, advocated for years to negotiate such a worldwide treaty to regulate international arms trade. Other states – including
a number of significant arms exporters – were less keen to adopt international norms that would restrict their national leeway to export arms.

During the negotiations of the Arms Trade Treaty, it soon became clear that reaching a global consensus would be impossible without watering down the quality of the Treaty to a point where advocate states would drop out. The proponents therefore decided to no longer aim for unanimity, but instead go for a stronger text with fewer signing state parties. In the end, 154 UN member states voted in favour of the Arms Trade Treaty in April 2013, three states voted “no” and 23 states decided to abstain.

The Treaty entered into force in December 2014, after 50 states ratified the treaty.

Despite the challenge of getting the majority of member states to vote for it, the ATT became a landmark treaty in regulating the international arms trade. It also set a new precedent as it became the first treaty to include provisions for preventing gender-based violence (GBV), requiring exporting states to consider the risk of arms being used in committing serious acts of GBV. Adding a reference to gender was a central part of civil society advocacy during the negotiations. Such efforts faced significant resistance from a few states, particularly the Holy See, which requested the term “violence against women” be used instead of GBV. With the help of the supporting states, however, the prevention of GBV was added as a legally binding criterion to the ATT. Almost a decade since it entered into force, the ATT gender-based violence provision has applied mostly in situations of serious violations of international law and human rights, less so in cases of GBV in domestic contexts.

The Arms Trade Treaty has two main objectives:

*	To establish the highest possible common international standards for regulating or improving the regulation of the international trade in conventional arms
*	To prevent and eradicate the illicit trade in conventional arms and prevent their diversion

The ATT is directed at states parties and obliges them to control arms export on a national level based on the agreed common international standards. Member states of the UN that have not ratified the Treaty are not bound by it.

Each state party is required to have a national arms export control system, including a national control list covering conventional arms such as battle tanks, combat aircrafts and attack helicopters. The ATT also explicitly applies to international transfers of small arms and light weapons. The items covered by the Treaty include those covered by other UN instruments such as the Firearm Protocol or the UN Register of Conventional Arms. Although the scope of the ATT does not fully cover munition and components, the Treaty obliges states parties to establish national export control systems for these products as well.

For the achievement of its second objective – combatting the illicit arms trade and preventing the diversion of these weapons – the ATT includes provisions on:

*	record-keeping, for example on export authorisations granted;
*	provisions on international cooperation and information exchange, for example on sharing information on illicit activities and actors or providing assistance with regard to stockpile management or the implementation of legislation;
*	and provisions for the requirement to take appropriate measures to address diversion.

Negotiating the ATT revealed fractures between importing and exporting states, between conflict-prone states and stable ones, and between strong states and fragile ones struggling with non-state actors. We can conclude that the ATT is a compromise text with few hard obligations and limited added value for those states which already have a well-functioning export control in place. The main merit of the ATT is that it has a global reach, it lifts the standards of those states that are not yet familiar with export controls, and if implemented successfully, it can facilitate international cooperation.

The core of the Treaty is the establishment of common prohibitions and assessment criteria. First of all, states parties are not allowed to authorise any arms transfer if this transfer would violate relevant international obligations of the transferring country, for example by breaking an arms embargo. States parties are also not allowed to authorise an international arms transfer if they have knowledge at the time of authorisation that the arms transferred would be used to commit genocide, crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva Convention or war crimes.

If they are not prohibited, exports are subject to a common set of criteria that states parties need to take into account when assessing arms export applications. In particular, states parties need to assess the potential that the weapons being exported would contribute to or undermine peace and security and the potential that the exported weapons could be used to commit or facilitate terrorism, organised crime or a serious violation of international law.

Moreover, states parties need to take into account the risk of exported weapons being used to commit or facilitate serious acts of gender-based violence or serious acts of violence against women and children. Violations of these additional assessment criteria will not necessarily lead to a denial of authorisation, however.

**Fact sheet: Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)**

The ATT came into force in December 2014. It focuses on export, but also includes a number of provisions on import, transit or transshipment, and brokering. The ATT obliges signatories to control arms export at the national level. It does not apply to the international movement of conventional arms by or on behalf of a state party for its own use, provided that the conventional arms remain under the ownership of that state party.

The ATT applies to the following eight categories of conventional arms:

*	Battle tanks
*	Armoured combat vehicles
*	Large-calibre artillery systems
*	Combat aircraft
*	Attack helicopters
*	Warships
*	Missiles and missile launchers
*	Small arms and light weapons

**As already mentioned, the ATT has two main objectives:**

*	To establish the highest possible common international standards for regulating or improving the regulation of the international trade in conventional arms.
*	To prevent and eradicate the illicit trade in conventional arms and prevent their diversion.

**Objective 1: Establishing common international standards for regulating the international trade in conventional arms**

*	National arms export control system
*	National control list on conventional arms (e.g. small arms and light weapons, battle tanks, combat aircrafts, attack helicopters)
*	National export control system for munition and other components

**Objective 2: Combatting the illicit arms trade and preventing the diversion of these weapons**

*	Record-keeping, e.g. on export authorisations granted
*	Provisions on international cooperation and information exchange, e.g. sharing information on illicit activities and actors or providing assistance with regard to stockpile management or the implementation of legislation
*	Requirement to take appropriate measures to address diversion

**Prohibitions**

A state party shall not authorise any transfer of conventional arms if:
*	this would violate its obligations under measures adopted by the United Nations Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, in particular arms embargoes;
*	this would violate its relevant international obligations under international agreements to which it is a party, in particular those relating to the transfer of, or illicit trafficking in conventional arms; or
*	the state knows that the items would be used in committing genocide, crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 or other specified war crimes.

**Assessment criteria**

Set assessment criteria on the risk the exported weapons pose in the following areas:
*	Contributing to or undermining peace and security
*	Potentially being used to commit or facilitate terrorism, organised crime or a serious violation of international law
*	Being used to commit or facilitate serious acts of gender-based violence or serious acts of violence against women and children

**Other provisions**

*	States parties can consider mitigation measures
*	States parties shall take measures to prevent diversion
*	States parties are required to keep records of export authorisations (G) or actual exports
*	States parties must submit annual report on authorised or actual imports and exports to the Secretariat
*	States parties are encouraged to provide international cooperation and assistance for implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty

As of March 2024, the ATT comprises 113 states parties, 28 signatories that are not yet states parties, and 54 states that have not yet joined the Treaty.

## The position of the EU towards the ATT
The EU has played a supportive role in the development of the ATT.

In 2005, the Council of the EU explicitly expressed its support for an Arms Trade Treaty for the first time. The Council agreed that the United Nations was the only forum that could deliver a truly universal instrument and the EU expressed its commitment to play an active role in this process.

Council conclusions calling for a legally binding Arms Trade Treaty were adopted on 11 December 2006 and 18 June 2007.

The representatives from the Council, the European Commission, the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the Delegation of the EU at the UN cooperated closely during the process leading up to the final approval of the Arms Trade Treaty.

*	The European Commission and the EEAS analysed the text proposals and supported member states in defining their positions.
*	The concern of the Commission was to make sure that the language of the Treaty would not infringe on EU legislation.
*	The EEAS coordinated consultations with member states in order to agree on common positions during the negotiations.

Adopting common positions was not an easy task and the EEAS encountered several difficulties in streamlining national concerns during the negotiations. However, the EU managed to present strong positions in the UN debate, for example that the consequences of the assessment of licence applications according to specific criteria should be clear and that criteria on corruption and sustainable development should be adopted. On other issues, such as the inclusion of civilian firearms, no agreement was reached among EU member states.

While the EU has been an active participant in the negotiations, it did not become party to the ATT (as is the case for the UN Firearms Protocol). However, all EU member states are parties to the ATT. In addition, the EU supports the implementation of the Treaty.

In 2021, for example, the EU adopted an outreach programme with a budget of 3.5 million euros to assist non-EU countries in strengthening their arms transfer systems in line with the requirements of the ATT.

With the aim of effective implementation and universalisation of the ATT, the EU supported activities of the ATT secretariat with a budget of 1.4 million euros (in 2021) and 1.3 million euros (in 2023)
