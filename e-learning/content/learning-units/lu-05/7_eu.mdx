For the European Union (EU), the NPT holds a central position within the framework of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. It serves as a fundamental basis for pursuing nuclear disarmament and plays a crucial role in facilitating the peaceful utilisation of nuclear energy. To enhance the effectiveness of the NPT regime, the EU places its support behind both the institutional and normative aspects of the treaty’s underlying processes.

The EU’s engagement under the NPT is driven by the objective of fostering a more secure world, while simultaneously promoting international stability, peace and security. In line with this objective, the EU has consistently advocated for the universalisation of the NPT. EU member states have repeatedly pledged to mobilise political determination and advance the implementation of NPT objectives through various initiatives, including the Stockholm Initiative.

With the adoption of the 2003 European Security Strategy, the EU committed to carry out several actions supporting multilateral regimes and institutions involved in countering nuclear proliferation and pursuing nuclear disarmament. For instance, between 2007 and 2013, the EU invested around 110 million euros in the support of the IAEA’s effort against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the illegal trafficking of nuclear material. In 2003, the EU also adopted a Strategy against WMD Proliferation, making nuclear non-proliferation a fundamental objective of the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). The Strategy states the NPT must be ‘preserved in its integrity’.

On the occasion of the 10th Review Conference on the NPT in 2022, and in light of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and the consequential risks concerning the nuclear security of the region, the EU issued an official statement inciting ‘all States Parties to the NPT, as well as the EU, to reiterate the unequivocal support for the NPT as the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime, the essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament in accordance with Article VI of the NPT and an important element in the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes’. The EU further encouraged states that are not yet parties of the NPT to join the treaty and adhere to its terms.

According to some experts, the EU has traditionally adopted a rather conservative approach of strengthening existing regimes. As a matter of fact, the EU does not envision policies directly addressing nuclear proliferation, but rather limits its scope of action to promoting regional stability in nuclear weapon states. Moreover, the EU has yet to translate its non-proliferation objectives stated in high-level documents into its regional approaches, as in the case of Iran.

The EU has affirmed its primary objective within the nuclear non-proliferation regime as the reinforcement of the regime itself through active support for the success of the NPT Review Conferences (RevCons), which the Union recognises as a significant platform to promote awareness of its non-proliferation policy. Since the 1990s, the EU has consistently endeavoured to coordinate the positions of its member states during the RevCon through joint statements and working papers, in addition to individual member states’ contributions.

Assessments of the EU’s performance in the context of the NPT review are varied. Some experts commend its consensus-building role and improved coordination of member states’ positions, and consider the EU a champion of the NPT. However, the prevailing perception is that the EU’s stance towards the NPT is low profile and passive, and that the Union has not achieved major successes within the NPT framework.

The complexity of the RevCons is a significant challenge for the EU, given the diverse interests of 190 state parties and the strategic concerns underlying the discussions. The EU lacks the competence to act on behalf of its member states in this forum, and it is not a member of the NPT itself. Moreover, the EU comprises both NWS and NNWS, each with their own sovereign nuclear interests, which can be highly divergent, thus further highlighting the heterogeneity of preferences within the EU. These factors contribute to the complexities and limitations faced by the EU in its efforts to achieve significant progress within the NPT framework.
