  It is customary for important multilateral international treaties to be regularly reviewed by the contracting state parties in order to assess the functioning of the treaty, the obstacles the states encounter in its implementation and their achievements. When this happens regularly, this process is called a ‘review cycle’, in this case the NPT Review Cycle.

  The review process starts with Preparatory Committee, or ‘PrepCom’, meetings, where state parties select the most pressing issues to be addressed in the Review Conference, or  RevCon, which is held every five years. During each conference, three commitees (each representing one of the treaty’s pillars) work on the issues, with the aim of adopting a final document.

  As of today, ten RevCons have been held, only three of which succeeded in adopting a final document, and the record is mixed regarding their broader achievements. It is important to reflect on the specific circumstances that led to such uneven outcomes.

  We will pay special attention to the 1995 RevCon, which marked a defining moment as it negotiated a ‘package deal’ consisting of a resolution on the Middle East, and three crucial decisions: to strengthen the review process for the NPT; to establish a series of principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament; and to extend the NPT indefinitely.

  Subsequent RevCons achieved several other important results, including the 13 practical steps toward nuclear disarmament drafted in 2000, and the 64-point Plan of Action produced in 2010. A key aspect of the Plan of Action concerned the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons – an element on which state parties continued to reflect in the following years, resulting in the so-called Humanitarian Pledge at the 2015 RevCon. However, the same conference in 2015 saw significant disagreement on the Middle East WMD-free zone, and the 2020 conference was overshadowed by Russia’s opposition to the conference’s proceedings in light of its war on Ukraine.

## Art. VIII.3 and the PrepCom

Article VIII.3 of the NPT stipulated that five years after the treaty’s entry into force, state parties should hold a conference aimed at reviewing its operation.[^1] In May 1975, therefore, NPT members held the first **Review Conference (RevCon)**. Since then, every five years, state parties have held a RevCon intended to review the implementation of the NPT over the preceding five years.

Each RevCon is conducted under three **Main Committees**, which respectively reflect Articles VI, I-II-III and IV of the treaty. Main Committee I is on disarmament, Main Committee II is on non-proliferation and Main Committee III is on peaceful uses of nuclear technology. A General Committee coordinates the work of the three Main Committees.

In between RevCons, state parties meet for what are known as **Preparatory Committee (PrepCom)** meetings, aimed at addressing substantive and procedural matters ahead of the Conference. Since 1995, state parties have met for an annual ten-day PrepCom meeting for the three years preceding the RevCon. Normally, a RevCon would be preceded by three PrepCom meetings – with the sole exception of the 1995 Conference, for which state parties met a fourth time, in the same year of the RevCon, in order to resolve outstanding issues.

## The 1995 Review and Extension Conference
The **1995 RevCon**, which took place at the UN Headquarters in New York from 17 April until 12 May 1995, marked a turning point. Despite being unable to adopt a Final Document, state parties negotiated what was referred to as a ‘package deal’ consisting of three Decisions and one Resolution.

  - **Decision 1**[^2]: To strengthen the **review process** for the treaty. State parties decided a RevCon should be held every five years, and that ten-day PrepCom meetings should occur annually in each of the three years prior to the RevCon. They also confirmed the three Main Committees structure of the Conference.

  - **Decision 2**[^3]: Principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. More specifically, state parties agreed that:
      - **universal adherence** to the treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was an urgent priority;
      - every effort had to be made to implement the NPT in all its aspects to **prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons**;
      - the treaty’s undertakings with regard to **nuclear disarmament** were to be fulfilled with determination;
      - NPT members should work towards the establishment of internationally recognised **nuclear-weapon-free zones**;
      - an **internationally legally binding instrument** could have prevented the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons;
      - the **IAEA** was the competent authority responsible for verifying and assuring compliance with its safeguards agreements with NPT state parties;
      - particular attention should have been directed towards the right of all NPT state parties to develop research, production and use of **nuclear energy for peaceful purposes**.

  - **Decision 3**[^4]: **Indefinite extension** of the NPT. Concern over this decision was expressed by the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), in particular, as they feared that the indefinite extension of the treaty would enable nuclear-armed states to hold on to their arsenals and abdicate any responsibility for eliminating them. Yet, the majority voted for the NPT extension.[^5]

Lastly, through the **Resolution on the Middle East**[^6], NPT members commit to the enforcement of the aims and objectives of the Middle East peace process; encourage all the states of that region which are not yet NPT state parties to sign the treaty and place all nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards; and appeals to Middle Eastern states to take practical steps towards the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction.

## Achievements over the years
After the **1995 RevCon**, NPT state parties continued to hold a RevCon at the UN Headquarters in New York every five years. While some Conferences were able to reach a consensus over a Final Document, others failed to fulfil this objective.

The **2000 RevCon** ended with the adoption of a Final Document[^7], which was mostly made possible by the negotiation of a group of middle powers known as the **New Agenda Coalition (NAC)**[^8]. The group encompassed foreign ministers of Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia, South Africa and Sweden (Slovenia and Sweden later withdrew from the NAC).  The document listed 13 **practical steps**[^9] to advance nuclear disarmament:

  - Utmost effort to achieve the entry into force of the **Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)**
  - **Moratorium** on nuclear explosions
  - Importance of negotiating a **Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT)**;
  - Role of the **Conference on Disarmament (CD)** and necessity to create a subsidiary body with a mandate on nuclear disarmament
  - Unequivocal undertaking from NWS to accomplish complete elimination of their nuclear arsenals
  - Entry into force and implementation of START II, conclusion of START III and preservation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM Treaty)
  - Establishment and implementation of a **Trilateral Initiative** between the US, Russia and the IAEA
  - A series of steps for all NWS to adopt in order to accomplish nuclear disarmament:
    1. Further unilateral reductions
    1. Increased transparency
    1. Further reduction of non-strategic nuclear weapons (NSNWs)
    1. Agreement over measures to reduce operational status of nuclear weapons (NW)
    1. Agreement over reducing the role of NW in security policies
    1. Engagement by NWS in the process leading towards the complete elimination of NW
  - Agreement of all NWS to place fissile material no longer required for military purposes under the control of the IAEA or other relevant international verification arrangements
  - Reaffirmation of the principle of general and complete disarmament
  - Agreement to conduct regular reporting on progress in nuclear disarmament
  - Further development of verification mechanisms for nuclear disarmament

**The 2005 RevCon failed to produce an agreed action plan** to achieve nuclear disarmament. State parties demonstrated polarised views on disarmament, and they **could not agree on a Final Document**. NWS showed a complete lack of willingness to discuss the matter of disarmament, which caused a procedural stalemate during the Conference, leaving insufficient time to reach consensus on relevant matters. An additional source of concern was the fact that the US did not send a high-level delegation to the Conference, which signalled a lack of trust in the process and therefore in the goal of the Conference itself.

While failing to produce a consensus review of the treaty implementation, the **2010 RevCon** was able to agree upon a **64-point Plan of Action**[^10]. The Plan built heavily on the 13 practical steps discussed in the context of the 2000 RevCon, and also addressed two more crucial elements:

1. A commitment to hold a conference of Middle Eastern states in 2012 to discuss the creation of a **WMD-free zone**
2. A reference to the **humanitarian consequences** of nuclear weapons

Indeed, state parties showed deep concern about potential **humanitarian consequences** of any use of NWs. Building on this, between 2013 and 2014, three conferences were organised to discuss the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons, through a process that became known as the **Humanitarian Initiative** (Norway, March 2013; Mexico, February 2014; Austria, December 2014). The conclusion the state parties reached was that the consequence of the use of NWs would be **catastrophic**, would **transcend national borders**, and would be **beyond the international community’s ability** to respond and provide relief.

In 2015, a total of 123 countries endorsed the **Humanitarian Pledge**, namely a commitment to fill the ‘legal gap’ for the prohibition and elimination of NWs. Such commitment concerned five main steps[^11]:

  - Present the facts-based discussions, findings and evidence of the meetings held in Norway, Mexico and Austria
  - Follow the imperative of human security for all and promote the protection of civilians against the risks stemming from NWs
  - Encourage NPT members to renew their commitment to the urgent and full implementation of existing obligations under Article VI
  - Appeal to NWS to take concrete interim measures to reduce the risk of nuclear weapon detonations
  - Cooperate with all relevant stakeholders, states, international organisations, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movements, parliamentarians and civil society[^12]

Much like the 2000 RevCon, the **2015 RevCon** failed to reach agreement on the substantive part of the draft Final Document. This was mainly due to diverging views on the Middle East WMD-free zone. The differences in views between the Middle Eastern states themselves increased in the five years leading up to the Conference, and eventually they agreed to fix the date for a Middle East Conference for the following year.[^13]

Due to Covid-19 restrictions, the **2020 RevCon** was finally held in **2022**. The members of the NPT failed to achieve consensus over the review of the treaty implementation. Most of the disagreements are attributable to **Russia**’s opposition to the RevCon proceedings in light of its recent invasion of Ukraine.

The next RevCon is scheduled for 2026 with sessions of the Preparatory Committee held in 2023, 2024 and 2025.
