## Why history is important

<LectureVideo smil="/lu05/HSFK-PC_LU05-CH01_08d_240510.smil" provider="video-stream">

  The modern nuclear non-proliferation regime with its established rules, norms and institutions, is easily taken for granted. But its development was not inevitable, and it is important to consider how it came to be.

  It is sometimes argued that the nuclear non-proliferation regime was born when the NPT entered into force in 1968, but this is an overly simplistic interpretation. Although the treaty is the legal-political framework that has made it possible to define many of the rules, norms and procedures critical to the regime’s functioning, there are other legal instruments, institutions and groupings of states that make it work. Moreover, many instruments and institutions (including the IAEA) were already in place when the NPT entered into force. In our view, the NPT should be seen as a result of the development and evolution of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, not its initiator.

  It is therefore important to start with a historical review of the origins and evolution of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, from the first theoretical conceptualisation of nuclear fission in 1933, the Frisch-Peierls Memorandum in 1940, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, initial meetings and draft proposals debated at the United Nations from 1946, up to the adoption of the NPT in 1968. Looking back at the origins of the nuclear non-proliferation regime will not only provide a historical-political context for its evolution, but will also supply the scientific-technical knowledge required to understand the continued development of nuclear technology and science, and their military implications.

## The beginning of the nuclear era

In 1933, Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard was the first to conceive the notion that uranium atoms could split and produce a nuclear chain reaction, opening the possibility of developing a nuclear explosive device.

However, the idea that it was possible to manufacture such a weapon was dismissed because of the amount of uranium needed to start the chain reaction. It was not until Otto Frisch and Rudolph Peierls suggested that uranium-235, a fissile isotope of uranium, could be extracted from uranium ore, and that this would be able to sustain the chain reaction, that the notion of such a device was taken seriously.

The Frisch-Peierls Memorandum persuaded the British government to fund a bomb project led by the MAUD committee. The British, however, came to the conclusion that they could not bear the financial cost of the research and development of the atomic bomb, and over the course of 1941, sent most of their research outputs to the US. This led to the creation, in 1942, of the Uranium Committee, set up to study the possibilities of developing such a weapon.[^1]

By the spring of 1945, the work of the Uranium Committee had led to the notorious ‘Manhattan Project’ and in 1945, scientists and engineers were ready to begin assembling the bomb which, by the end of May 1945, led to a demonstration explosion against Japan being proposed in order to bring about an early end to the war.[^2]  At the same time, on 16 July 1945, at 5.30 a.m, the first successful test of an atomic bomb took place at Alamogordo, New Mexico.

In the summer 1945, the US, UK and China sent an ultimatum to Japan calling on them to surrender unconditionally or face _‘immediate and complete destruction[^3]’_. Japan’s failure to respond sealed the fate of Hiroshima and Nagasaki: On 6 August 1945, the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and on 9 August, the second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Japan surrendered unconditionally on 14 August 1945. The nuclear weapon had entered the battlefield.

  <Tab title="Harold Clayton Urey">
    Harold Clayton Urey was an American chemist and university professor. A pioneer in isotope work, he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1934, and subsequently developed the Theory of Paleontological Evolution based on his discoveries in the field of atomic physics. During the Second World War, he headed a research group at Columbia University on methods of separating the uranium isotope U-235 from U-238 and the production of heavy water. He also contributed to the development of the hydrogen bomb. After this research, he was very active in the group of atomic scientists calling for international control of atomic energy.

    Ernest O. Lawrence (Canton, 8 August 1901-Palo Alto, 27 August 1958) was an American nuclear chemist best known for the invention, use and improvement of the cyclotron, and for his later work on the isotopic separation of uranium during the Manhattan Project. He founded two nuclear research laboratories: Berkeley and Livermore. During World War II, he developed electromagnetic isotope separation at the UC Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. After the war, he strongly supported Edward Teller's campaign for a second nuclear weapons laboratory, which Lawrence sited at Livermore.

    J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904–1967) was an American theoretical physicist and scientific director of the Manhattan Project, leading the development of the first atomic bomb during World War II. As head of the Los Alamos Laboratory (1943–1945), he coordinated efforts to design and construct nuclear weapons, playing a key role in the successful Trinity test in July 1945. His leadership and scientific expertise were crucial in bringing together top physicists, including Fermi and Teller. After the war, he opposed nuclear proliferation and was later stripped of his security clearance during the Red Scare. Oppenheimer is often called the “father of the atomic bomb.”

    Edward Teller (1908–2003) was a Hungarian-American physicist best known for his pivotal role in the development of nuclear weapons. As a key figure in the Manhattan Project during World War II, he contributed to the theoretical groundwork for the first atomic bomb. Although not directly responsible for the bomb’s design, his research on fusion reactions laid the foundation for the hydrogen bomb, which he later championed during the Cold War. Teller played a controversial role in advocating for advanced nuclear weaponry and was instrumental in establishing the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to enhance U.S. defense capabilities.

      Enrico Fermi (1901–1954) was an Italian-American physicist whose groundbreaking work in nuclear physics was crucial to the development of the atomic bomb. As a key figure in the Manhattan Project, he led the first controlled nuclear chain reaction at the University of Chicago in 1942, proving that nuclear fission could be harnessed for energy and weaponry. His expertise in neutron physics and reactor design directly influenced bomb development at Los Alamos. Fermi’s contributions helped pave the way for both atomic energy and nuclear weapons, securing his legacy as one of the most influential physicists of the 20th century.

## The first international efforts to ban nuclear weapons

The sheer destruction caused by the new nuclear weapons hit many people hard. It is therefore not surprising that at the first meeting of
the UN General Assembly (UNGA) on 24 January 1946, the first resolution adopted was to establish an Atomic Energy Commission, charged
among other things with submitting proposals for _‘the elimination of atomic weapons from national armaments’[^4]_. The resolution was adopted unanimously by all 51 member states.

<Resolution name="A/RES/1(I)"/>

The US government, meanwhile, had anticipated these developments by establishing an advisory commission under the chairmanship of David Lilienthal to consider proposals for the establishment of a United Nations commission to control the international development of atomic energy. Bernard Baruch was appointed to present the proposal to the United Nations.[^5]

On 14 June 1946, Baruch presented the proposal to the UN General Assembly (UNGA). It called for a ban on the manufacture of atomic bombs and for all phases of the development and use of atomic energy to be placed under international authority. Compliance would be ensured through verification processes. However, until a treaty to this effect was approved by the United Nations and entered into force, the United States was to continue to have a monopoly on atomic secrets and would not commit to ending the production of new atomic weapons until there were effective and secure controls, including on-site verification on Soviet territory.

Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko rejected the US proposals and on 19 June 1946, presented an alternative proposal that would see all parties commit to not using atomic weapons; prohibit the production or maintenance of such weaponry; and required the destruction of all existing weapons within three months of the treaty’s adoption.

However, the Soviet Union offered no means of verification in support of its proposals, making them unacceptable to the United States.[^6]

The failure of negotiations in June of that year ended the first attempt to eliminate atomic weapons, and by the mid-1950s, US and Soviet leaders had rejected the idea of banning them and instead sought ways to control them, thereby strengthening deterrence with a view to reducing the risk of nuclear war.[^7]

## The Irish resolution
On 17 October 1958, a significant event took place that years later would directly influence the negotiation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty: Ireland submitted to the UNGA the first draft resolution highlighting the dangers posed by the increase in the number of states in possession of nuclear weapons. The proposal called for the formation of an ad hoc committee to study these dangers and for all states to suspend nuclear testing, nuclear powers not to supply nuclear weapons to other states, and non-nuclear states to cease any efforts to develop nuclear weapons. However, this initial proposal did not find sufficient support and had to be withdrawn.[^8]

A year later, in 1959, Ireland sent its proposal back to the Ten Nations Committee on Disarmament, established to address the issue of nuclear disarmament during the Cold War, suggesting that the adoption of an international agreement subject to controls and inspections could be an effective mechanism for controlling nuclear proliferation.[^9]  On this occasion, the US responded favourably, considering the proposal to be consistent with the objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear cooperation with other states. However, the Soviet Union rejected it on the grounds that it did not exclude the possibility of installing nuclear weapons outside the territory of the nuclear weapon states themselves.[^10]

In 1960, a second text submitted by Ireland went further than the initial proposal of 1958, as it made it clear that the aim of the resolution was the adoption of a permanent non-proliferation agreement and therefore required non-nuclear states to commit not to acquiring nuclear weapons.[^11] It also required the nuclear weapon states to cease transferring nuclear technology, as well as information relevant to the manufacture of nuclear weapons to non-nuclear states.

This proposal was approved by the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries, enabling its final approval by the UNGA on 4 December 1961, with the United States and other NATO allies abstaining. The resolution represented the first step towards the negotiation of a comprehensive Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

## The Eighteen Nation Committee and the negotiation of the NPT
The attempt to place all nuclear activities of states under the control of an international organisation was too ambitious and difficult to implement because of opposition from the major nuclear powers, and had to be replaced by negotiations to achieve individual elements of such a strategy. The first element of these negotiations was the adoption of a nuclear non-dissemination treaty, based on the proposals contained in the Irish resolution of 1958. Negotiations for the adoption of a Nuclear **Non-Proliferation Treaty** started in spring of 1965 in the Eighteen Nation Committee.

The negotiation process was divided into **two phases**. In the first phase, the two major powers (the US and the Soviet Union) discussed possible ways forward for the NPT negotiations. The second phase involved multilateral discussions aimed at formulating the specific clauses to be contained in the treaty.[^12]

Despite the difficulties, a set of proposals and provisions to prohibit the transfer of nuclear weapons to non-nuclear countries were drafted. The final decision was taken during the 20th session of the UN General Assembly with the adoption of **Resolution 2028 (XX)**[^13]. The Resolution contained five basic principles which would go on to form the basis of a subsequent Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. These principles were:

  1. To prevent loopholes that could allow nuclear or non-nuclear states to proliferate nuclear weapons, either directly or indirectly, in any form.
  2. To establish an acceptable balance of mutual responsibilities and obligations between nuclear and non-nuclear states.
  3. To open the path towards general and complete disarmament.
  4. To include acceptable and directly applicable provisions to ensure its effectiveness.
  5. To guarantee the right of any group of states to conclude regional treaties with a view to securing the total absence of nuclear weapons in their respective territories.

After several amendments, the United States and the Soviet Union jointly submitted the draft final text of the NPT to the Eighteen Nation Committee on 14 March 1968. The United Nations General Assembly adopted the treaty by Resolution 2373 on 12 June 1968.
