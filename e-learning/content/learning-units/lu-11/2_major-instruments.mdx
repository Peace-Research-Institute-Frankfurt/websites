## The CFE Treaty

This chapter will discuss the three main parts of the European conventional arms control system developed in the 1990s. The Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty, the Open Skies Treaty and the Vienna Document on Confidence and Security-Building Measures. Together, they formed the foundation of the cooperative approach to security and, despite the recent setbacks, provide a point of reference for potential future work on re-establishing arms control in Europe.

### The CFE Treaty: Numbers and definitions
<LectureVideo smil="/lu11/HSFK-PC_LU11-CH01_13a_250122.smil" provider="video-stream">

  One of the main features of the first Cold War in Europe was the large numerical advantage the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact had over NATO in terms of major conventional weapons, such as tanks or artillery. In the West, this fuelled fears of a surprise large-scale conventional attack aimed at overwhelming NATO’s defences.

  As the Cold War was coming to an end, a window of opportunity opened to deal with this challenge by using arms control measures to reduce the stocks of conventional weapons in Europe and to increase the stability of the NATO–Warsaw Pact relationship.

  These were the origins of the [Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe](https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/4/9/14087.pdf), or the CFE Treaty, signed on 19 November 1990. The Treaty entered into force on 9 November 1992, with 30 participating states.

  The original aim of the Treaty was to establish a numerical balance in major weapons between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.

  The so-called Treaty-Limited Equipment (TLE) included five categories of weapons:
  - tanks
  - armoured combat vehicles
  - heavy artillery
  - combat aircraft
  - attack helicopters

  Initial ceilings for each side (NATO and Warsaw Pact) were: 20,000 tanks; 30,000 armoured combat vehicles; 20,000 heavy artillery pieces; 6,800 combat aircraft; 2,000 attack helicopters.

  Equipment exceeding the agreed limits was to be eliminated through destruction or conversion. The CFE included the host nation consent rule: no foreign conventional forces can be stationed on one’s territory without the agreement of the hosting state. The CFE states were obliged to provide information about their military holdings, update them and allow intrusive on-site inspections on their territory to verify this information.

  The Treaty covered the territories of the state parties between the Atlantic and the Ural Mountains, and originally also included provisions for different zones: additional restrictions on the numbers of tanks, armoured combat vehicles and heavy artillery were included for specified areas in Northern and Southern Europe (the flanks).

  The CFE Treaty was often referred to as the **cornerstone of European security**. While the security landscape in Europe was changing rapidly with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, as well as NATO enlargement, the Treaty (with some corrections reflecting, e.g. the emergence of new countries in the post-Soviet space) provided a foundation of military stability for the continent.

  Around **52,000 pieces** of Treaty-Limited Equipment were eliminated in accordance with the Treaty between 1992 and 1995. If voluntary reductions are also added, more than **69,000 pieces of Treaty-Limited Equipment** were eliminated altogether, including more than 26,000 tanks and 2,600 helicopters. Thousands of inspections and verification visits have been conducted.

### The CFE Treaty (II): Implementation, problems and path to irrelevance
  <LectureVideo smil="/lu11/HSFK-PC_LU11-CH02_13a_250122.smil" provider="video-stream">



    As with any treaty as complex as the CFE, there were implementation problems from the very beginning with Russia repeatedly exceeding its Treaty limits for some categories of TLE during its military operations in Chechnya. Armenia and Azerbaijan were accused of non-compliance with the Treaty in the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.

    In 1999, the parties to the CFE reached an agreement on a significant update, or **adaptation of the Treaty**. Instead of the outdated bloc-based approach and flank zones, new national and territorial limits of equipment holdings were agreed. The Treaty was opened for new states to join.

    As well as accepting the Adapted CFE at the OSCE Summit in Istanbul, Russia made a number of political commitments, including pledges to withdraw its Treaty-Limited Equipment and troops from Moldova and close its bases in Georgia. NATO states made it clear that they would not ratify the Adapted CFE if these pledges were not met.

    Russia argued that the continued application of the original CFE Treaty was detrimental to its security interests and that the connection made by other countries to Istanbul commitments was unfounded. The Adapted Treaty was ratified by Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. Russia called on NATO countries to ratify the Adapted CFE as soon as possible. Since this did not happen, **in 2007, Russia suspended implementation of the CFE.** After emergency talks on the future of the CFE ended in failure, in 2011, NATO countries and some of their partners stopped providing treaty-related information to Russia and declared that they would not accept Russian inspections.

    As one of the consequences of the war on Ukraine and its confrontation with NATO, the Russian Duma decided, in May 2023, to withdraw completely from the CFE Treaty, a decision which took effect in November 2023. In response, 22 NATO countries which were parties to the CFE decided to suspend the operation of the CFE Treaty ‘for as long as necessary’. Some of them had also decided at an earlier point to suspend providing information and accepting inspections from Belarus, due to its participation in the Russian aggression against Ukraine.

    Without the participation of Russia, and with NATO members and also Belarus suspending the implementation of their obligations, the CFE’s importance and restraining function in European security has dramatically diminished.

## Open Skies Treaty

The [Open Skies Treaty](https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/1/5/14127.pdf) was first proposed by U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower in 1955. The president’s idea was that the United States and the Soviet Union would allow reconnaissance overflights of each other’s territory to make sure that no surprise attack was planned. Unfortunately, the proposal was rejected by the Soviet Union as an attempt to sanction spying.

Towards the end of the Cold War, political relations between the two superpowers improved significantly. When the idea of observation flights was reintroduced by the US in 1989, it was picked up by a number of NATO and Warsaw Pact countries. After three years of negotiations, the Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992. [^1]

The Treaty entered into force in 2002. As of early 2020, there were 34 state parties to the Treaty, covering the area from Vancouver to Vladivostok.

The basic characteristics of the Open Skies regime are:
- The flights can only be conducted by unarmed, specially certified aircraft.
- Overflights can take place over the whole territory over which a state party exercises sovereignty, including the land, islands, internal and territorial waters – no areas or military installations are off-limits.
- Images from the flights are shared by the observing and observed country. They are also made available to other state parties, but these must specifically request and pay for them.
- Each aircraft can carry only specially certified sensors: video cameras, optical cameras, infrared sensors and synthetic aperture radar (allowing images of objects to be created).
- Introduction of new technology – for example use of digital camera instead of film – must be agreed by all parties. The quality of the images should be sufficient to permit recognition of major military equipment.
- Each state is assigned a specific quota of observation flights that it is obliged to receive every year (passive quota), and it is permitted to conduct the same number of flights in other parties itself (active quota).

Before the Open Skies Treaty entered into force in 2002, around 350 trial flights took place. Since then, around 100 observation flights have been conducted every year. The year 2013 saw the 1,000th observation flight conducted under the Open Skies and in October 2019 – the 1,500th flight.
The Open Skies Treaty website offers an interesting and interactive [visualisation of the flights between 2002 and 2019](https://openskies.flights/).

Observation flights under the Open Skies Treaty are meant to:
- improve openness and military transparency between all the parties through cooperative actions;
- contribute to conflict prevention and crisis management (for example, Open Skies overflights were used in 2013 and 2014 to monitor the deployment and movement of Russian forces in the vicinity of Ukraine);
- double-check the information provided by a particular country about its military posture through other agreements and confidence-building regimes, such as the Vienna Document, and help monitor compliance with them.

Throughout the existence of the Treaty, there were also implementation issues and disputes, for example connected with overflights in the border areas (e.g. between Russia and Georgia, or along Turkey’s border with Syria), as well Russia’s imposition of a 500-kilometre limit for certain observation flights over Kaliningrad. In the US internal debate, it was also argued that Russia was obtaining significantly more intelligence benefits from the data collected under the Treaty, and modernising its data-collecting aircraft, whereas the importance of the Treaty for the US was less clear, given the availability of high-quality data from its satellites.

These arguments led the Trump administration to announce the US withdrawal from the Open Skies Treaty in May 2020. The decision was based on allegations of repeated Russian violations of the Treaty. The withdrawal took effect on 22 November 2020. This was followed immediately by Russia moving to pull back from the Treaty, with its withdrawal becoming effective in December 2021.

The Treaty on Open Skies remains in operation for the remaining 32 states, and some observation flights still take place. But without US and Russian participation, its relevance for European security is limited.

## The Vienna Document

<LectureVideo smil="/lu11/HSFK-PC_LU11-CH03_13a_250122.smil" provider="video-stream">

  The Vienna Document focuses on **Confidence and Security Building Measures, CSBMs, and risk reduction**. These measures are aimed at reassuring all sides about the lack of aggressive intentions of other countries, avoiding accidental or inadvertent escalation and promoting cooperation. They also improve military stability by increasing the level of contact and predictability regarding the actions and plans of other countries, and are seen as elements of a gradual process of helping states to overcome their security dilemmas and move towards the development of cooperative security system. Unlike the legal obligations contained in the CFE and Open Skies Treaty, the Vienna Document is politically binding.

  The zone of application of the Vienna Document covers the whole of Europe, the adjoining sea and air space, as well as the territory of the Central Asian countries – also members of the OSCE – with the exception of Mongolian territory.

  From the relatively basic measures adopted in the 1960s and 1970s, the range and sophistication of the CSBMs increased significantly in the late 1980s and early 1990s. As the Cold War came to an end, CSBMs were seen as instruments to support a new inclusive security system in Europe. In the process, new or expanded measures were gradually added to the existing set of commitments. They were included in the 1986 Stockholm Document and the Vienna Document adopted in 1990 as well as its subsequent updated editions issued in 1992, 1994 and 1999. The latest version of the Vienna Document agreed by all members of the OSCE was issued in 2011.

  ></Figure>

  Some of the most important CSBMs and risk reduction measures in this document include:

  - annual exchanges of military information (budget, organisation of armed forces, equipment);
  - exchange of information on military planning and doctrines, exchange of calendars for notifiable military activities;
  - risk reduction mechanisms for dealing with military incidents and unusual military activities, for example a sudden concentration of large forces at the border;
  - prior notification (42 days before their start, or earlier) and invitation of observers to what are known as ‘certain military activities’. To be notifiable, these activities need to exceed specified thresholds, such as minimum number of troops participating or minimum amount of equipment being used. Observers must be invited to the notifiable activities if they equal or exceed separate, higher thresholds;
  - voluntary limits on the frequency of massive-scale exercises;
  - military-to-military contacts, including visits to military facilities, port calls, demonstrations of new types of major weapons systems;
  - inspections (of areas) and evaluation visits (to units);
  - encouragement to agree regional or bilateral CBMs above and beyond the Vienna Document requirements.

**Dealing with unusual military activities: the Vienna Document’s risk reduction procedure**

The following outlines the Vienna Document’s risk reduction procedure as regards unusual military activities (see Chapter 3 paragraph 16):
- Concerns about an unusual and unscheduled activity of another state’s military forces outside their normal peacetime locations which are militarily significant and are within the zone of application for CSBMs

  🠗
- Request for an explanation, stating the cause of concern and the type and location of activity (transmitted to all OSCE participating states)

  🠗
- Reply, delivered to requesting state within no more than 48 hours (transmitted to all OSCE participating states)

  🠗
  1) Concerns dispelled, reply accepted; 2. Concerns not dispelled

  🠗
- Request for a meeting with the responding state (transmitted to all OSCE states)

  🠗
- Meeting convened within no more than 48 hours, with the presence of other invited interested states, under the chairmanship of the OSCE Chairman-in-Office (CiO) or his/her representative.

  🠗
- Report from the meeting prepared by the CiO or representative and sent to all OSCE states

  🠗
  1) Concerns dispelled, situation stabilised; 2. Concerns not dispelled

  🠗
- Meeting of all participating states in the forum of the OSCE Permanent Council (PC) and the Forum for Security Co-operation (FSC), convened by CiO within 48 hours on the initiative of either the requesting or responding state

  🠗
- The PC and FSC assess and recommend appropriate measures for stabilising the situation and halting activities that give rise to concern

A number of weaknesses of the Vienna Document have been identified since its last update in 2011. Since it is not a legally binding instrument, its implementation by a particular country relies to large extent on that country’s good will and ‘peer pressure’ from other participants.
  <Callout title="Weaknesses of the Vienna Document" >
<DetailsGroup>
  <Details summary="Information exchange" open={true}>

    The scope of the Vienna Document’s information exchange on military forces and weapons does not cover some important elements of modern armed forces, including missile systems, naval forces and uncrewed vehicles.

  </Details>
  <Details summary="Notification thresholds" open={true}>

    The thresholds for notification and observation of exercises are seen as too high. The majority of military exercises that have taken place in Europe were smaller and fell below the thresholds. Moreover, the so-called ‘surprise’ or ‘snap’ exercises, even the largest-scale ones, do not have to be announced in advance, which constitutes a loophole.

  </Details>
  <Details summary="Risk reduction mechanisms" open={true}>

    The risk reduction mechanisms, including for unusual or unscheduled military activities, depend on the cooperation of the country where the activity is taking place, which may not always be forthcoming.

  </Details>
</DetailsGroup>
</Callout>

The implementation of the Vienna Document has also been negatively affected by the increased tensions in Europe and by Russia’s war on Ukraine.

In particular, the Vienna Document’s risk reduction mechanism for unusual and unscheduled activities was used in 2021 and 2022 to raise the alarm about military activities in Belarus and Russia in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border, but the procedure did not dispel concerns or change Russia’s war plans. In February 2022, Russia refused to attend the joint session of the Permanent Council and the Forum for Security Co-operation to assess the situation regarding its unusual military activities (see the procedure above).

Russia accused a number of other participating states of not providing the required information and notifications about their military activities and exercises, and in 2023, it announced that it would no longer be providing information about its armed forces within the framework of the Vienna Document’s annual exchange.[^2]
