## Nuclear weapons in Europe
This chapter will now present the nuclear dimension of European arms control. It examines the status of nuclear arsenals globally and the difference between strategic and non-strategic nuclear weapons. It also discusses the prospects and challenges connected with including Russian and US non-strategic nuclear weapons deployed in Europe in potential arms control negotiations and agreements.

### Background information and definitions

  **Categories of Nuclear Weapons**

  <Term t="Nuclear-weapons" displayBy="title"/> can be categorised in various ways, by explosive type, <Term t="delivery-vehicle" displayBy="title"/> , target, yield or a combination of all four [see also LU04](/lu-04/). Within the European context, much attention is given to the distinction between strategic and non-strategic (tactical) nuclear weapons. There is no internationally agreed definition of non-strategic nuclear weapons, however, which sometimes leads to confusion in policy and expert discussions.

  The (unofficial) [U.S. Defense Department’s Nuclear Matters Handbook](https://www.acq.osd.mil/ncbdp/nm/NMHB2020rev/index.html) defines non-strategic or tactical nuclear weapons as ‘nuclear weapons designed to be used on a battlefield in military situations.

  This is opposed to strategic nuclear weapons, which are designed to be used against enemy cities, factories, and other larger-area targets to damage the enemy’s ability to wage war.’

  This definition presents challenges, as what is considered tactical from an abstract perspective, might be deemed strategic on the actual battlefield. This ambiguity was underscored by former U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis, who stated in 2018 that ‘any nuclear weapon used any time is a strategic game changer’.

  In arms control circles, the prevailing distinction categorises non-strategic nuclear weapons as those that are not designated as ‘strategic’ by (strategic) arms control treaties. According to this perspective, strategic weapons are of intercontinental range, while non-strategic weapons are not. While this distinction is useful, it is important to keep in mind that it primarily refers to the nuclear superpowers, the US and the Soviet Union/Russia, and overlooks the arsenals of other nations. Notably, France and the UK regard all their nuclear weapons as strategic, irrespective of range.

  Since the end of the Cold War, non-strategic nuclear weapons have become an increasingly important topic in arms control discussions. This shift in focus occurred as both the United States and Russia downsized their strategic arsenals, while Russia reintroduced non-strategic systems that had previously been eliminated.


 ### The status of nuclear arsenals

  If nuclear weapons are categorised as strategic or non-strategic based on range for the US and Russia, but not for other countries, the result is the following expert estimate of arsenals around the world in 2024:
  | Country        | Deployed strategic nuclear weapons | Deployed non-strategic nuclear weapons | Reserve/non-deployed[^1] | Military stockpile[^2] | Total inventory[^3] |

  There is currently uncertainty regarding the number of Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons (NSWS) and their deployment status, with the Kremlin formally announcing its intention, in March 2023, to deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus. Russian NSNWs are declared to be in central storage, not located in bases together with delivery systems.

### US non-strategic nuclear weapons

The United States currently possesses only one type of NSWS: the B-61 gravity bomb. Experts estimate that the United States maintains approximately 200 such bombs in its stockpile, with roughly half of them deployed across six bases located in five European countries: Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Türkiye.[^4]

The exact locations and quantities of the current deployments have not been publicly disclosed, however, and remain subject to expert estimates. They represent a significant reduction compared to the Cold War era when the US maintained over 7,000 forward-deployed nuclear weapons in Europe.

### NATO nuclear sharing

The permanent deployment of US nuclear weapons in Europe is often referred to as NATO nuclear-sharing arrangements (see also LU05). Nuclear sharing does not mean that one country simply hands control over its weapons or launch authority to another country. The weapons stationed by the United States on the territories of its allies remain firmly under US custody and control.

During periods of conflict, the US forward-deployed weapons may be made available to allies. Should the situation arise, the B-61 would be delivered by dual-capable aircraft (DCA), which are specifically modified to carry both nuclear and conventional weapons. Both the United States and (several of) its European allies have DCA.

According to [**NATO’s own communications**](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2022/2/pdf/220204-factsheet-nuclear-sharing-arrange.pdf)

  <Quote type="document" fullDocument="https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2022/2/pdf/220204-factsheet-nuclear-sharing-arrange.pdf" cite='NATO Headquarter'>
    ‘a nuclear mission can only be undertaken after explicit political approval is given by NATO’s Nuclear Planning Group (NPG) and authorization is received from the US President and UK Prime Minister’.
  </Quote>

This approval process highlights the complex political considerations that NATO’s nuclear strategy involves.

### Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons

As shown above, Russia is believed to currently possess between around 1,000 and 2,000 non-strategic nuclear warheads including warheads for short-range ballistic missiles, air- and sea-launched missiles, and missile defence forces.

It is important to note, however, that there are major uncertainties surrounding the precise count. Most of Russia’s non-strategic weapons systems are <Term t="dual-capable"/>, which means that some of them may be designed for conventional rather than nuclear missions. In addition, increases in the number of dual-capable launchers do not necessarily imply a corresponding increase in the number of nuclear warheads assigned to them. Many of the delivery platforms are also being overhauled and not all are deemed capable of launching nuclear weapons at this time.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union deployed nuclear weapons in several of its republics and satellites. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, these weapons were repatriated to Russia.

Russia recently announced that it planned to resume the practice of deploying nuclear weapons abroad. In a formal announcement on 25 March 2023, the Kremlin declared its intention to deploy non-strategic nuclear weapons in Belarus. Experts remain uncertain about whether the weapons have since been transferred to Belarus or where they might be stored.

While the current stockpile of Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons represents an important reduction compared to the Cold War, the Kremlin still attributes significant importance to them. The Russian non-strategic arsenal is seen by Moscow as offsetting the superior conventional forces of NATO, especially of the United States. In addition to addressing NATO’s conventional capabilities, experts have argued that Russia also considers its non-strategic nuclear weapons as a means to counterbalance China’s large and increasingly capable conventional military forces and to maintain nuclear parity with the combined forces of the United States, the United Kingdom and France.


## Nuclear arms control in Europe

States pursue arms control to mitigate the likelihood of war. European arms control measures can be categorised along the following three dimensions.

###  European nuclear-weapon-free zones (NWFZ)
There have been multiple attempts at establishing a NWFZ in Europe but so far to no avail (see also LU06).

The Soviet Union first initiated discussions on a NWFZ in Europe in 1956 within the United Nations, but these discussions did not progress beyond the committee level. In 1958, the Polish government presented the Rapacki Plan, named after the Polish foreign minister, as a tangible proposal for a NWFZ in Central Europe. The proposed NWFZ would include the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic, Poland and Czechoslovakia, with other European countries having the option to join. Ultimately, however, the Rapacki Plan was rejected by NATO.

Proposals for a Nordic NWFZ or a NWFZ in the Balkans were discussed during the Cold War but never advanced to formal negotiations. Belarus proposed a NWFZ for Central and Eastern Europe in 1991, which did not materialise either.

Article VII of the nuclear 1968 Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) affirms the right to establish NWFZ.


### Limits and reductions in nuclear arsenals

**The strategic level**

Over the past five decades, the United States and the Soviet Union/Russia have concluded a number of agreements that limited and reduced their nuclear arsenals. The table below includes an overview of the key agreements pertaining to their strategic arsenals, the limitations they impose and the time period covered.

|                       | **SALT I**         | **SALT II**                   | **START I**        | **START II**                 | **START III**               | **SORT**                  | **New START**         |

In February 2023, the Kremlin announced the suspension of Russia’s participation in New START.


**The non-strategic level**

While the vast majority of efforts in this regard have focused on strategic arsenals, **two major sets of initiatives**[^5] focused on non-strategic nuclear weapons.

In 1987, the United States and the Soviet Union concluded the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which aimed to eliminate ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles (and related launchers) with ranges of between 500 and 5,500 km. Over time, both sides raised concerns about compliance. The United States accused Russia of testing and developing prohibited missiles (the Novator 9M729 missile, also known as RS-SSC-8 Screwdriver). Specifically, the 9M729 is a ground-launched cruise missile with an estimated range of 2,500 km, thus exceeding the intermediate-range cutoff enshrined in the INF. Meanwhile, Russia denied that it had breached the INF and countered the accusation with allegations of US violations linked to missile defence systems. While the Aegis Ashore system is intended to intercept incoming ballistic missiles, Russia argued that it could easily be modified to launch INF-prohibited cruise missiles. Russia also expressed concerns that the United States is testing missile defence systems using target missiles that are similar to intermediate-range missiles. Lastly, Moscow has accused the United States of making armed drones that are functionally equivalent to ground-launched cruise missiles, which the INF also prohibits. The US government has consistently maintained that US actions in all three areas were either not prohibited by or not subject to the INF Treaty. In 2019, the United States formally withdrew from the INF Treaty because of concerns about both Russian non-compliance and China’s growing missile arsenal.

In 1991, the US announced that it would unilaterally eliminate a number of non-strategic nuclear weapons and withdraw nearly all of them from deployment. In response, the Soviet Union committed to eliminate a large number of its own non-strategic nuclear weapons and pledged to withdraw non-strategic naval nuclear weapons from deployment. Experts estimate that these Presidential Nuclear Initiatives (PSI) led to a reduction of 5,000 non-strategic nuclear warhead deployments for the United States and 13,000 for the Soviet Union/Russia.


## Challenges for nuclear arms control in Europe

<LectureVideo smil="/lu11/HSFK-PC_LU11-CH05_13a_250124.smil" provider="video-stream">
  There are several conceptual challenges to engaging in nuclear arms control talks in Europe today, even if we leave aside the political dimension.

  ### Stand-alone or integrated approach
  NATO and Russia have divergent views on whether it is best to address non-strategic nuclear weapons as a stand-alone category or not.

  In the last few years, NATO has actively pursued initiatives to engage Russia in reducing risks associated with non-strategic nuclear weapons. Efforts have included encouraging information exchanges on quantities of weapons, along with joint visits to former deployment sites.

  While Russia has not rejected talks on non-strategic nuclear weapons outright, it has resisted NATO’s proposals. The Kremlin insisted that any focus on these weapons must be part of a broader framework that also addresses its concerns regarding the weapons of other NATO countries. Specifically, it has made any reduction in its own arsenal of non-strategic nuclear weapons conditional upon the complete withdrawal of US forward-deployed nuclear weapons in Europe, discussions on missile defence, space and long-range non-nuclear systems and the conventional balance in Europe.

  ### Qualitative versus quantitative focus
  In the past, negotiations over formal arms control treaties focused on quantitative limitations to establish the desired balance between US and Soviet/Russian forces. This left both sides free to pursue qualitative improvements through modernisation and technological change, albeit on a reduced scale. Recent research, for example, has suggested that the strategic arms control agreements concluded during the Cold War enabled the United States to leverage its technological superiority to forge ahead. The arms control treaty limited the ability of the Soviet Union to effectively compete because it could no longer counter US qualitative improvements by increasing its own numerical strength.

  The possibility of focusing mostly on quantitative measures is further undermined by the proliferation of non-nuclear technologies with strategic applications.  Advances in precision, tracking, sensing and processing power today potentially enable states to threaten an adversary’s nuclear systems with non-nuclear weapons, including, for example, conventional precision and prompt strike weapons, new methods of tracking and attacking nuclear-armed submarines or counter-space and anti-satellite technologies. The risk of cyber-attacks on nuclear systems, either directly or through hacking into command and control apparatus or indirectly through interference with early warning systems, poses additional challenges in this area. Taken together, these conditions emphasize the need to focus on
  qualitative outcomes, rather than quantitative inputs in arms control negotiations.

  ### Verification of agreements on non-strategic nuclear weapons
  Ensuring and verifying compliance with arms control agreements, particularly when it comes to non-strategic nuclear weapons, has been a persistent challenge. Compared to strategic arsenals, verifying compliance with agreements on non-strategic weapons poses greater difficulties due to factors such as ambiguous definitions, disparities in stockpiles and warhead movements. The aforementioned blurred line between the nuclear and non-nuclear domains further complicates verification efforts.

  ### Regional versus global arms control approach
  The present juncture marks a pivotal moment in US nuclear strategy, unprecedented since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Previous arms control efforts primarily focused on the balance between the United States and Russia. However, there is a growing concern among US policymakers about China’s rapid nuclear expansion. This emerging nuclear ‘tripolar competition’ is raising questions about whether arms control initiatives should embrace a multilateral approach, inclusive of China, or engage Russia and China separately, but concurrently.
