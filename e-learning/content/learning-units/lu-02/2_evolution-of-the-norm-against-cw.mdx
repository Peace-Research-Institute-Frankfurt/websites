## Early Attempts Against CW

[Podcast]
The use of poison is as old as humankind. Likely, humans used poison first as a force multiplier when hunting big game before it became a weapon of combat. Ancient writings clearly indicate that societies were ambivalent about the use of poison in combat.

The first written statements against the use of poison and poisoned weapons in combat expressed a particular society’s moral values. The oldest known document is the Manusmrti (the Tradition of Manu). It was compiled in the second or first century BCE and forms one of the foundations of Hindu code. Religions have had a restraining influence on the conduct of war and on the use of poisons in particular. Neither the Old and New Testaments nor the Qur’an discuss poisoning and consequently do not contain any formal prohibition. The origins of contemporary laws of war can be traced to the teachings of the Prophet Mohammed in the 7th century and the influence of Christianity and chivalry on the conduct of war in the Middle Ages. Because of the diaspora, Jews did not engage in organised warfare until the foundation of Israel in 1948. As a consequence, Judaism never developed similar religious constraints on poison warfare.

From the Renaissance onwards, many European legal scholars stimulated the discussion of constraints on warfare. They testified to certain practices that either were or ought to be banned. Poisons were invariably among the weapons they considered unlawful. Certain military formations, as well as armies from emerging sovereign states, began adopting such prohibitions as part of their code of conduct. However, these unilateral expressions of behaviour on the battlefield did not bind other civilisations or political entities.

In the 19th century, the sovereign state established itself as the dominant form of social organisation, which increased the opportunities for international treaties. Furthermore, industrialisation and technological innovation rapidly changed the nature of warfare, as a consequence of which the leading powers began codifying the customs of war. In 1899, they convened in The Hague for the first Peace Conference. There they concluded two multilateral agreements. The Hague Convention (II) codified the customs and laws of war. It included the age-old ban on the use of poison and poisoned weapons. The second document, the Hague Declaration (IV,2) prohibited the use of asphyxiating or deleterious gases. This was the first time that asphyxiating gases became separated from poison, a clear reflection of the growing impact of science and industrialisation on future warfare.

These agreements did not prevent the use of asphyxiating gases in the First World War. After the Armistice in 1918, the League of Nations looked into banning chemical weapons. This resulted in the Geneva Protocol of 1925, which is still in force today. Diplomats, however, intended this document to lay the foundation for a comprehensive disarmament treaty. The failure of the League of Nations’ Disarmament Conference in the 1930s meant that the Geneva Protocol remained the only restriction on chemical weapons until the Chemical Weapons Convention entered into force in 1997.

## Early Constraints on Chemical Warfare

### Early bans on poisoned weapons

The _Manu Smrti_, a foundation of Hindu law, contains the earliest recorded prohibition on poison (G) use. It is over 2,000 years old. History also shows that cultures in different parts of the world adopted similar codes. However, the unilateral codes were not legally binding for the enemy.

Religions opposed indiscriminate warfare, which is the root of the ban on poisons. In Islam, this evolved from the prohibitions on flooding and fire in the 10th century. Christianity began framing similar codes in the Middle Ages. However, these applied only to one’s own religious community. The diaspora prevented Judaism from developing similar rules.

With the rise of the sovereign state, formal codification of the rules of war began in multilateral conferences during the second half of the 19th century. The industrial revolutions also generated the first interest in arms control, but constraining technology was an idea whose time had not yet come.



### First Hague Peace Conference

Fearing the impact of industrialisation on armaments, Russia, an agrarian society, convened the 1899 Hague Peace Conference. The meeting failed to limit armaments, but with the Hague Convention (II) and the annexed Regulations it codified the laws and customs of war on land. The document included an overall ban on the use of poison and poisoned weapons.

In recognition of technological progress, the Conference also concluded Declaration (IV,2) Concerning Asphyxiating Gases, outlawing the use of projectiles designed to diffuse asphyxiating or deleterious gases. The focus of the regulation, however, was on ‘use’, not the weapon as such.

The 1907 Hague Conference updated the Convention with its Regulations but maintained the Declaration on asphyxiating gases. Most independent states at the time signed the document.

In 1915, the first large-scale chemical attack of World War I circumvented the prohibition because the chlorine gas used was released from cylinders in the trenches rather than being delivered by projectiles.

### The Geneva Protocol

The 1925 Geneva Protocol (G) prohibits chemical and biological methods of warfare (G). It is a direct descendant of the 1899 Hague Declaration (IV,2) and the 1919 Versailles Treaty banning Germany from using CW.

Even though the Geneva Protocol was never violated for biological warfare, on several occasions, it was unable to prevent CW use. However, nations came together each time to renew their commitment to the agreement. Thus, it gradually became part of customary law and is now seen as universally binding and applicable to any type of armed conflict.

Today, it offers the legal foundation for the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biolgical Weapons. Its language has also been incorporated into the 1998 Rome Statute (G) establishing the International Criminal Court.

### Breakthrough: The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)

After the negotiations and adoption of the Geneva Protocol in 1925, it took more than 50 years for negotiations on a significantly more comprehensive treaty to start within the UN Conference on Disarmament. In the 1930s, the League of Nations (the precursor to the United Nations) convened the Conference for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments, which, if successful, would have led to a comprehensive ban on chemical weapons. The meeting ended in failure in 1934 as a consequence of Japan’s invasion of China, Italy’s war of conquest in Ethiopia and the armaments build-up in Europe. After World War II, nuclear weapons and the Cold War dominated security considerations. However, systematic CW use by the US in the Viet Nam War led the UN General Assembly to adopt several resolutions expressing the need to strengthen the Geneva Protocol in the second half of the 1960s and studies into the consequences of chemical and biological warfare were requested by the UN Secretary-General and the World Health Organisation.

These developments contributed to chemical and biological weapon disarmament being put on the agenda. The separation of biological weapons from chemical weapons led to the adoption of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention in 1971 and its entry into force in 1975. Meanwhile, a CW ban languished until the 1980s. Especially after the US introduced a draft convention in 1984, negotiations intensified and picked up speed towards the end of the decade because of CW use in the Iran–Iraq War. Negotiators concluded the CWC in 1992 and it entered into force in 1997.

### Genesis and structure of the CWC

The Chemical Weapons Convention is a global, multilateral treaty that bans the development, acquisition, possession and use of chemical weapons. Negotiations were concluded in September 1992, and the document was opened for signature in January 1993. It entered into force on 29 April 1997.

### OPCW structure

The Chemical Weapons Convention established the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons or OPCW. Every state party to the CWC is a member of the OPCW. The OPCW is based in The Hague, The Netherlands. It oversees the implementation of the treaty provisions and ensures that all states remain compliant with their obligations. It is an independent body and not part of the family of United Nations organisations.

The OPCW is a forum where state parties meet and decide both on implementation strategies and the practical management of the treaty. It also has a Technical Secretariat with an international inspectorate and specialised staff. In addition, several subsidiary bodies inform decision-making, the most prominent one being the Scientific Advisory Board, which monitors and regularly reports on the impact of science and technology on the CWC, or addresses technical questions put to it.

**General Purpose Criterion**

Chemical warfare agents have often been toxic industrial chemicals in widespread use, or their production rested on commonly used chemicals, known as precursors. Banning chemical weapons, therefore, requires the control of dual-use technologies, which have legitimate applications but can also be used for weapon development. The CWC addresses the dual-use challenge by means of the so-called General Purpose Criterion. In essence, the CWC does not ban chemicals, but the goal to which they may be applied.

For example, in 2015, global annual production of chlorine exceeded 60 million tonnes, up from 44 million tonnes 20 years earlier. The CWC does not interfere with its legitimate production and trade, despite it having been the first toxic chemical used on a large scale in the World War I. However, following confirmation of the repeated use of the toxic chemical as a weapon in the Syrian civil war, the OPCW condemned the use of chlorine as a method of warfare in February 2015.

The General Purpose Criterion offers another advantage. Because the prohibition on chemical weapons is not specific to certain chemical compounds, it also covers any toxic chemical that will be discovered in future. In other words, it allows the Chemical Weapons Convention to remain relevant in view of scientific and technological developments.

**Verification**

The CWC has a declaration-based verification system. First, a state party must declare any chemical weapons it possesses, which are verified by the Technical Secretariat and then destroyed under its supervision. Second, a state party must declare the industrial production of toxic chemicals.

The existence of the OPCW, however, does not mean that individual state parties have no responsibilities under the CWC. Quite the contrary, the CWC foresees a division of labour between the Technical Secretariat and the state party. Each state must establish a National Authority, which liaises between a state party’s government and the Technical Secretariat, as well as with National Authorities of other state parties.

The principal task of the National Authority is to collect all relevant information from civilian and military facilities whose activities fall within the scope of the CWC and report the data to the Technical Secretariat. The National Authority also acts as a contact and host for the international inspection teams entering the country. Much of the effectiveness of the verification system actually depends on the effectiveness of the national systems.

**Compliance**

Declarations by state parties on CWC-related activities and national implementation of certain treaty provisions, including the need for national implementation legislation, form the foundation for compliance.

Any unreported or erroneously reported activity is a violation of CWC, but the violation is not necessarily deliberate and can be easily remedied. To address anomalies of a more serious nature, the CWC foresees consultations between the Director-General of the OPCW and a state party or between state parties, formal clarification requests, and challenge inspections. The Technical Secretariat can also investigate allegations of use of chemical weapons, as has been the case during the Syrian civil war.

Given that the CWC is essentially a cooperative security regime, the preference is clearly for resolving anomalies at the lowest level of confrontation.

**Success**

When the CWC entered into force in 1997, overseeing the destruction of declared chemical
weapons and installations associated with their production and storage was one of the
OPCW’s biggest responsibilities and challenges. Eight countries declared chemical
weapons arsenals with a total of 72,304 metric tons of warfare agents and 417,833 items, including munitions and containers. On 7 July 2023, the OPCW certified the destruction of all declared CW.

The Chemical Weapons Convention has been successful in eliminating all declared chemical weapon stockpiles. As of April 2024, a total of  193 states have ratified or acceded to the CWC, making the treaty as good as universal.

### Reinforcing the norm against CW

While the CWC (and the Geneva Protocol) form the backbone of the norm against CW today, the international community has devised other instruments to support it. As has been the case since the late 19th century, security challenges evolve faster than the codification process.

The new tools tend to be action-oriented. They are the responsibility of individual states and implementation objectives are set against specific timelines. Other characteristics often include the informal nature of the arrangement, the formation of a coalition of like-minded states, and the absence of lengthy, formal negotiations to set the instruments up.

Another trend is the rising prominence of humanitarian and human rights law with the attendant focus on criminalising individual behaviour under international law.

The tools presented here are four of many initiatives launched or reinforced since the end of the Cold War.

**Australia Group**

The Australia Group (AG) is an informal grouping of 42 states and the EU that aims to counter the spread of technologies and materials used for chemical and biological weapons through coordinated export controls, information sharing and outreach. It reviews its technology control lists at its annual meetings.

It was originally created in 1985 after the UN confirmed Iraq’s use of CW the year before.

**UN Secretary-General’s Investigative Mechanism**

The UN Secretary-General’s Investigative Mechanism evolved from the investigations into Iraq’s violations of the Geneva Protocol between 1984 and 1988. Formalised by UN resolutions, it allows the UN Secretary-General (UNSG) to dispatch fact-finding missions at the request of a UN member.

When it comes to CW, the UNSG now draws on OPCW capacities and expertise to investigate alleged use by or in a non-CWC party. (The OPCW can launch its own investigations if a member state is involved.) For BW cases, the UNSG maintains a roster of national experts.

**UNSC Resolution 1540 (2004)**

After 9/11, the Security Council passed   several anti-terrorism resolutions, including 1540, (G) which aims to prevent terrorist acquisition of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. All UN members must adopt and enforce Resolution 1540, as well as report to the 1540 Committee on appropriate national legislation.

With regard to CW, the obligations parallel those of Article VII of the CWC, but apply to all UN members.

**The 1998 Rome Statute and the ICC**

The Rome Statute (G) defines CW use as a war crime in both international and internal conflicts. The Hague-based International Criminal Court can pursue such violations if national courts are unwilling or unable to try criminals or after a UNSC referral.

The Rome Statute uses the language of the Geneva Protocol and does not refer to the CWC or BTWC (G), as some countries wished to avoid any reference to nuclear weapons.
