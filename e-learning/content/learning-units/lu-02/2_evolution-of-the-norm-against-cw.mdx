## Early Constraints on Chemical Warfare

<LectureVideo smil="lu02/HSFK-PC_LU02-CH02_11a_241127.smil" provider="video-stream">
  The use of poison is as old as humankind. Likely, humans used poison first as a force multiplier when hunting big game before it became a weapon of combat. Ancient writings clearly indicate that societies were ambivalent about the use of poison in combat.
  The first written statements against the use of poison and poisoned weapons in combat expressed a particular society’s moral values. The oldest known document is the Manusmrti (the Tradition of Manu). It was compiled in the second or first century BCE and forms one of the foundations of Hindu code. Religions have had a restraining influence on the conduct of war and on the use of poisons in particular. Neither the Old and New Testaments nor the Qur’an discuss poisoning and consequently do not contain any formal prohibition. The origins of contemporary laws of war can be traced to the teachings of the Prophet Mohammed in the 7th century and the influence of Christianity and chivalry on the conduct of war in the Middle Ages. Because of the diaspora, Jews did not engage in organised warfare until the foundation of Israel in 1948. As a consequence, Judaism never developed similar religious constraints on poison warfare.

  From the Renaissance onwards, many European legal scholars stimulated the discussion of constraints on warfare. They testified to certain practices that either were or ought to be banned. Poisons were invariably among the weapons they considered unlawful. Certain military formations, as well as armies from emerging sovereign states, began adopting such prohibitions as part of their code of conduct. However, these unilateral expressions of behaviour on the battlefield did not bind other civilisations or political entities.

  In the 19th century, the sovereign state established itself as the dominant form of social organisation, which increased the opportunities for international treaties. Furthermore, industrialisation and technological innovation rapidly changed the nature of warfare, as a consequence of which the leading powers began codifying the customs of war. In 1899, they convened in The Hague for the first Peace Conference. There they concluded two multilateral agreements. The Hague Convention (II) codified the customs and laws of war. It included the age-old ban on the use of poison and poisoned weapons. The second document, the Hague Declaration (IV,2) prohibited the use of asphyxiating or deleterious gases. This was the first time that asphyxiating gases became separated from poison, a clear reflection of the growing impact of science and industrialisation on future warfare.

  These agreements did not prevent the use of asphyxiating gases in the First World War. After the Armistice in 1918, the League of Nations looked into banning chemical weapons. This resulted in the Geneva Protocol of 1925, which is still in force today. Diplomats, however, intended this document to lay the foundation for a comprehensive disarmament treaty. The failure of the League of Nations’ Disarmament Conference in the 1930s meant that the Geneva Protocol remained the only restriction on chemical weapons until the Chemical Weapons Convention entered into force in 1997.

### Early bans on poisoned weapons
<DetailsGroup>

  <Details summary="The Manusmrti, a foundation of Hindu law">

    The Manusmrti, a foundation of Hindu law, contains the earliest recorded prohibition on poison (G) use. It is over 2,000 years old. History also shows that cultures in different parts of the world adopted similar codes. However, the unilateral codes were not legally binding for the enemy.

    Religions opposed indiscriminate warfare, which is the root of the ban on poisons. In Islam, this evolved from the prohibitions on flooding and fire in the 10th century. Christianity began framing similar codes in the Middle Ages. However, these applied only to one’s own religious community. The diaspora prevented Judaism from developing similar rules.

    With the rise of the sovereign state, formal codification of the rules of war began in multilateral conferences during the second half of the 19th century. The industrial revolutions also generated the first interest in arms control, but constraining technology was an idea whose time had not yet come.

  <Details summary="First Hague Peace Conference">

    Fearing the impact of industrialisation on armaments, Russia, an agrarian society, convened the 1899 Hague Peace Conference. The meeting failed to limit armaments, but with the Hague Convention (II) and the annexed Regulations it codified the laws and customs of war on land. The document included an overall ban on the use of poison and poisoned weapons.

    In recognition of technological progress, the Conference also concluded Declaration (IV,2) Concerning Asphyxiating Gases, outlawing the use of projectiles designed to diffuse asphyxiating or deleterious gases. The focus of the regulation, however, was on ‘use’, not the weapon as such.

    The 1907 Hague Conference updated the Convention with its Regulations but maintained the Declaration on asphyxiating gases. Most independent states at the time signed the document.

    In 1915, the first large-scale chemical attack of World War I circumvented the prohibition because the chlorine gas used was released from cylinders in the trenches rather than being delivered by projectiles.

  <Details summary="The Geneva Protocol">
    The 1925 Geneva Protocol (G) prohibits chemical and biological methods of warfare (G). It is a direct descendant of the 1899 Hague Declaration (IV,2) and the 1919 Versailles Treaty banning Germany from using CW.

    Even though the Geneva Protocol was never violated for biological warfare, on several occasions, it was unable to prevent CW use. However, nations came together each time to renew their commitment to the agreement. Thus, it gradually became part of customary law and is now seen as universally binding and applicable to any type of armed conflict.

    Today, it offers the legal foundation for the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biolgical Weapons. Its language has also been incorporated into the 1998 Rome Statute (G) establishing the International Criminal Court.
