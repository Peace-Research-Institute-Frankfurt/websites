Modern chemical warfare (G) began on 22 April 1915 with the release by German Imperial troops of a massive chlorine cloud near Ypres, Belgium. The war became an accelerating competition between increasingly lethal agents and improvements in chemical defence. By late 1918 50% of all shells fired were chemical.

### Spanish Morocco

Between 1921 and 1927 Spain and France deployed various chemical warfare agents against the Berber rebels during the Rif war. It was the first use of CW in a colonial war.

### Italo-Abyssinian War

Italy resorted to CW (G) in its colonial campaign against Ethiopian troops between October 1935 and May 1936.

### China

During the 2nd Sino-Japanese war (1937–45) Japan experimented with toxic chemical agents and used them extensively during the battle of Changde (November – December 1943)

### Threat perceptions during the Interbellum

With the armistice chemical warfare ended.

Expectations were that if the war had continued into 1919 CW use would have surpassed that of conventional munitions. One new type of agent, Lewisite, was on board of transport ships en route from the USA to Europe when the arms fell silent.

The fear of CW did not disappear, however. World War 1 had been a war of innovation and aeroplanes in particular became part of future threat visions. Bombers armed with CW could annihilate whole cities, so it was feared. Politicians, peace campaigners, humanitarian organisations, etc., painted apocalyptic pictures of the end of humanity not unlike current views of nuclear warfare.

In Europe, a balance of terror combined with national civil defence preparations were among several factors that contributed to the prevention of gas warfare in World War 2.

## Major CW Incidents After 1945

### Viêt-Nam war

During the 1960s the USA progressively intensified the spraying of herbicides and defoliants over Viêt-Nam and neighbouring countries to deny North Viêt-Namese forces and insurgents jungle cover. Chemicals such as Agent Orange permanently destroyed large parts of the vegetation and are still the cause of illness and birth defects among the local population and US veterans.

### Yemen civil war

Between 1962–70 several allegations were made that Egypt resorted to CW (G) during its intervention against Royalist forces. Some 40 incidents were reported.

### Iran–Iraq war (1980–88)

Iraq initiated the largest CW use since World War 1 in 1982, possibly earlier. From late 1983 on CW became a regular feature and in the final two years systematised their use against Kurdish insurgents and civilians. Iran is not believed to have resorted to CW.

### Syrian civil war

In 2013, two years into the war, reports of CW increased, culminating in the sarin attack against Ghouta in August. Since joining the CWC (G), attacks have continued with chlorine by both government forces and ISIL.    

### Cold War and its aftermath

World War 2 ended without sustained chemical warfare campaigns. The atomic bomb became the symbol of both military prowess and existential fear. CW disappeared to the background, but retained relevance for intra-war deterrence. The discovery of the extremely lethal and fast acting nerve agents in the 1930s drove post-war preparations. Up to end of the Cold War the USA and USSR built up and modernised arsenals comprising many tens of thousands of tonnes of warfare agents.

With the exception of the Viêt-Nam war, all major chemical warfare (G) occurred and is still occuring in the Middle East. It is a historical fact and psychological factor that has been mostly overlooked in the efforts to free the region from non-conventional weaponry.

In 1987 Iraq introduced CW as a means of genocide against the Kurds; a mode of warfare currently also being waged by Syria.

## Terrorism with Chemical Weapons

### How great a threat?

After the end of the Cold War concerns about catastrophic, mass-casualty terrorism rose fast. Aum Shinrikyo’s release of sarin in the Tokyo underground in March 1995 seemed to confirm the worst fears. After the 9/11 attacks against the USA, the fear escalated even further.

Until today the projected scenarios have not materialised. Acquisition of warfare agents have proved more complex than the availability of technologies and skills may suggest, not in the least because of the need for functional specialisation and the weapon programme alters internal group dynamics. Today greater transfer controls and law enforcement awareness have raised additional barriers.

Most incidents with toxicants are criminal in nature, including revenge attacks by individuals using commercial or off-the-shelf chemicals.

### Aum Shinrikyo’s high-tech apocalypticism

The Japanese cult developed an apocalyptic religious doctrine that required it to develop advanced weaponry to battle and survive the forces of evil. Its doctrine incorporated many science fiction elements, which was part of the group’s attraction for disaffected science and technology students and professionals.

Aum set up several weapon programmes, one of which was the production of 80 tonnes of sarin to help provoke Armageddon. It developed sarin and set up a production unit, which failed. However, the leadership became extremely paranoid about discovery as the project progressed.  It also came in increasing conflict with Japanese society and the internal pressure to use the sarin to demonstrate its power before achieving full capacity grew.   
In June 1984 it created a sarin vapour to kill three judges set to rule in a land dispute; in March 1995 it released sarin in metro trains in Tokyo with the aim of preventing police raids on cult compounds. A far cry from its original goals, but the CW programme led to the cult’s demise.

### ISIL’s opportunistic use of industrial toxicants

In 2006–07 al-Qaeda in Iraq launched a series of truck bomb attacks with chlorine against local Iraqi and US forces. The chlorine killed no one. AQI used the chlorine intended for water purification.
AQI became the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). In Syria it began experimenting with chlorine-filled mortar grenades, which in 2015 became more of a method of warfare rather than terrorism. It then expanded the practice in its operations against Kurds in Iraq. The OPCW (G) also confirmed incidents of ISIL mustard agent use in Syria and Iraq.

    <Question type="MultipleChoice" question="What is a chemical weapon? ">
        <Choice value=" It is impossible to precisely define a chemical weapon, because the boundaries with biological weapons, on the one hand, and nuclear weapons, on the other hand are fuzzy."/>
        <Choice value="A chemical weapon is any toxic substance that can harm living organisms that is used as a method of warfare."/>
        <Choice value="Chemical weapons are all toxic substances, delivery systems and other specialised equipment , except for riot control agents."/>
        <Choice correct value=" Chemical weapons are all toxic substances intended for use as a method of warfare, their delivery systems and other specialised equipment , together or separately."/>
    </Question>
    <Question type="MultipleChoice" question="How likely are terrorist attacks with chemical weapons?" hint="Multiple correct answers are possible">
        <Choice value="Quite likely: the ingredients and equipment are easily available and chemistry graduates have the basic skills needed to synthesise sarin or mustard agent"/>
        <Choice correct value=" Increased awareness of the threat and international cooperation have complicated the domestic and international technology acquisition for terrorists."/>
        <Choice correct value="Human factors such as internal group dynamics and pressures for early use to demonstrate technological prowess to members and the outside world will tend to contribute to the failure of the weapon programme."/>
        <Choice value=" The dynamics inside Aum Shinrikyo were unique. Future terrorist groupings will be able to overcome those impediments."/>
    </Question>
    <Question type="MultipleChoice" question="What is the difference between an incapacitant and an irritant? ">
        <Choice correct value=" In terms of the duration of effects , the symptoms of irritants will disappear soon after the end of exposure, whereas in the case of incapacitants the effects may last for hours or days after evacuation."/>
        <Choice value=" Irritants are solids, whereas incapacitants are much closer to nerve agents."/>
        <Choice value="Legally speaking there is no difference because both types are authorised for use as crowd control agents."/>
        <Choice value=" Incapacitants are toxic substances, whereas irritants belong to a category of agents in between chemical and biological weapons."/>
    </Question>
    <Question type="MultipleChoice" hint="Multiple correct answers are possible" question="Should I avoid using the term ‘gas’ when referring to chemical weapons? ">
        <Choice value="No. While ‘gas’ is not technically correct, people generally understand that ‘gas’ is synonymous with chemical weapon."/>
        <Choice correct value="Yes. ‘Chemical weapon’ refers to more than just the agent filling"/>
        <Choice value=" Yes. If I use ‘gas’ I will immediately betray to my audience that I am illiterate in the subject matter."/>
        <Choice correct value=" Yes. Today’s chemical warfare agents are mostly liquids or solids and only some types of agents used in World War 1 were gases in the proper sense of the word."/>
