Chemical weapons (G) are the one category of non-conventional weapons that have been and are still being used as a method of warfare (G) in spite of a long history of multilateral agreements to outlaw them.

The Chemical Weapons Convention (G) is today the most sophisticated international tool to prevent chemical warfare (G). It bans not only CW possession, but also the preparatory steps to chemical warfare: development, production and stockpiling of such munitions, as well as training in their offensive deployment. In addition any state party must declare and destroy under international supervision any stockpile it owns.

193 out of 197 UN members and observer states are now party to the CWC. This makes it the most successful weapon control treaty ever concluded.
Despite its obvious successes in eliminating CW – the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize testifies to the fact – the OPCW (G) faces important challenges in the mid- to long-term future.

Science and technology do not stand still. This means that new chemical molecules are being designed and possibly commercialised in increasing quantities. Many have properties that could make them interesting for future chemical warfare. The General Purpose Criterion (G) prohibits any such potential, and thus keeps the CWC abreast of such developments.

However, they impact on the CWC‘S verification (G)regime. To make reporting and industry inspections manageable the CWC uses three Schedules (G). However, ongoing reluctance to update them threatens to render the monitoring and inspection tools obsolete.

Furthermore, production processes evolve too and affect declaration requirements as well as monitoring requirements.

With the Syrian civil war the CWC has been confronted with chemical warfare, including allegations that a state party is in material breach of its obligations. The OPCW was successful in eliminating Syria‘s chemical warfare capacity, in spite of some uncertainties. The continuing use of chemical weapons by government and insurgent forces poses a serious challenge to the treaty‘s intergrity and requires concerted action by the international community.

Terrorism is a challenge for the OPCW. However, through international assistance and cooperation it can strengthen national legal and response capacities to prevent and respond to incidents. Chemical security and safety help to protect critical infrastructure.
