 Hello. I am Christopher Daase and I am a professor of international relations at Goethe University Frankfurt and the deputy director of Peace Research Institute Frankfurt, Germany.

 Hello. My name is Frank Kuhn and I am a doctoral researcher and project coordinator for the Cluster for Natural and Technical Science Arms Control Research at Peace Research Institute Frankfurt.

 In this learning unit, we will provide you with an introduction to the foundations of arms control and explain how arms control can help to promote international peace and security. The first chapter covers the key concepts of arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament, as well as how they relate to each more. Moreover, we discuss humanitarian arms control, counterproliferation and critical perspectives such as gender.

 In the second chapter, you will learn a bit about what arms control is meant to be controlling, i.e. weapons. We will show you the differences between weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons, and explain why emerging technologies are particularly difficult to control.

 In the third chapter, we discuss the many different forms that arms control can take. Here, you will find out more about the level of approach, legal aspects, the temporal dimension and factors of success, before going on to address how arms control works in practice by delving into the issues of verification and implementation. Lastly, we provide an outlook about the future of arms control in chapter five.

  We hope that you enjoy our learning unit.

For several decades, arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament played a key role in many states’ security and foreign policies.

However, the arms control architecture that has been in place since the Cold War is unravelling.<br/>
Conventional arms control in Europe has all but expired. Strategic nuclear arms control between Russia and the United States is on life support, while China is expanding its nuclear arsenal and remains unwilling to discuss nuclear risk reduction measures, let alone join the United States in serious arms control negotiations. The Biological and Chemical Weapons Conventions are under pressure after the use of chemical agents in Syria, the poisoning of Russian dissidents and unfounded Russian allegations of biological weapons activities in Ukraine. Ballistic missiles, drones and cruise missile systems are proliferating around the world. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence undermine traditional forms of quantitative arms control. Even seemingly successful humanitarian arms control initiatives, in particular the Convention on Cluster Munitions and the Mine Ban Treaty, have been unable to curb the widespread and devastating use of anti-personnel landmines and cluster munitions during the war in Ukraine.

Considering the dire state of arms control in virtually every domain, what rationale is there for states and non-state actors to allocate resources for arms control? And what do we actually mean when we talk about arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament?

To understand what arms control means, we first need to go back to the roots of modern arms control theory and the concept of stability, which were developed in the 1960s. It is also important to grasp that not all forms of arms control are necessarily aiming for stability – some focus on the security of human beings instead.

After a deep dive into the various concepts of arms control, we describe the different weapons and weapon systems, including their subcomponents, which can be regulated using arms control. Moreover, we discuss the different forms arms control can take in practice, be it negotiated, multilateral treaties or unilateral, non-binding political commitments, going on to explain why verification is so important. Lastly, we assess the possible future of arms control.



## Definition and objectives

<LectureVideo smil="/lu01/HSFK-PC_LU01-CH01_16b_250408.smil" provider="video-stream">
  Arms control is often used as an umbrella term for arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament. Sometimes, these three concepts are also used interchangeably. They are, however, not the same.

  Arms control is usually thought to encompass negotiated limits on or reductions in armaments with the aim of bringing about a stable equilibrium between two or more military powers and putting a brake on the arms race. In extreme cases, however, arms control might even include rearmament to restore an equilibrium, but with limited rather than unrestricted growth rates.<br/> Non-proliferation, on the other hand, aims to limit the number of states in possession of a particular type of weapon, rather than limiting the number of weapons. This includes obligating the possessor of a certain weapon (the ‘haves’) to refrain from supplying non-possessors (the ‘have nots’) with the respective weapons or related technology. Fundamentally, non-proliferation measures are therefore about maintaining the power of the possessor states over the rest of the international community and can be a point of contention between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have nots’. Lastly, disarmament aims to eradicate weapons, or at least a specific type of weapon, ideally entirely. Disarmament can be both a desired end goal and a process leading to this end goal. Thus, every arms control agreement that brings about a reduction in armaments may also be described as disarmament.

  To make things even more complicated, there are also additional subconcepts such as humanitarian arms control and counterproliferation that are playing an increasingly important role for international peace and security. Humanitarian arms control aims to improve the security and well-being of human individuals, rather than the security of the state, while counterproliferation involves a set of coercive measures to prevent states from acquiring specific military technologies.

  While it is important to note that there is no universal definition of arms control, most scholars would agree that it includes all forms of cooperation between potential adversaries contributing to one or more of three overarching goals:


  1. Reducing the likelihood of a hot war breaking out
  2. Reducing the scope of violence if war occurs
  3. Reducing the political and economic costs of being prepared for war

  Which of these three goals is the most important is, however, up for debate , but people usually focus on the first, deeming the other two of lesser importance.[^1]

  Arms control is usually thought to entail diplomatic negotiation, with the outcome being a formal treaty between two or more state parties limiting or prohibiting certain weapons. But as we will show in this learning unit, it can in fact take many different forms, some of which may even be non-cooperative. For example, arms control may involve both reductions and increases in certain weapons, qualitative restrictions or changes in weaponry, different modes of deployment, or the regulation of existing weapon systems, yet it almost always aims to contribute to one or more of three core goals presented above.


  The three goals of arms control are not necessarily compatible with each other. If states spend money on military forces, communication systems or redeployments, which limit the chance of  false alarms and misunderstandings in a crisis, then these measures could very well reduce the likelihood of war, but they would also entail significant financial investments in the military. Similarly, the merits of arms control do not always depend on whether or not the measures taken affect the size and composition of military forces. For example, hotlines for government-to-government communication – the so-called “red telephone”, which actually never was a telephone but a Teletype  -, s can also reduce the risk of war, but they would leave the military balance largely untouched. The same ist true for military deconfliction or improved intelligence that reduces the uncertainty about an adversary’s military capabilities and doctrine.[^2]

To understand how arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament can help reduce the likelihood of war, the scope of violence, and the political and economic costs of being prepared for war, we will now consider them each in a little more depth.

## The trinity of arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament


### Arms control
As set out above, the primary goal of arms control, as it is usually understood today, is to prevent or reduce the likelihood of the outbreak of war. This is generally done by maintaining stability.

#### Stability

Stability can mean different things to different people, but it is most commonly used to describe a state in which nobody has the incentive to strike first – that is, to start a war. This is also what is meant by the term ‘strategic stability’. The term ‘crisis stability’, in contrast, refers to the absence of incentives to strike first or gain a military advantage in a crisis, for example by launching a surprise attack.[^3]

But why might states feel compelled to strike first? In his seminal article _The Reciprocal Fear of Surprise Attack_, written in 1958, Thomas Schelling explains how this might come about.

<Quote fullDocument="https://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P1342.html" cite="Schelling, Thomas C. 1958. “The Reciprocal Fear of Surprise Attack”, P-1342. Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, p.1.">

  If I go downstairs to investigate a noise at night, with a gun in my hand, and find myself face to face with a burglar who has a gun in his hand, there is danger of an outcome that neither of us desires. Even if he’d prefer just to leave quietly, and I’d like him to, there is danger that he may think I want to shoot, and shoot first. Worse, there is danger that he may think that I think he wants to shoot. Or he may think that I think he thinks I want to shoot. And so on. 'Self defense's is ambiguous, when one is only trying to preclude being shot in self defense.

</Quote>

This, Schelling concluded, is the problem of surprise attack. In an environment where striking first carries an advantage – and at the time this was widely assumed to be the case – a party might well feel tempted to do so if it feels that war could be imminent. Consequently, the primary goal of arms control would be to stabilise the whole situation by reducing incentives that may lead to war.[^4]

Strategic stability is not the only form of stability that arms control can help to maintain. Another form of stability is arms race stability, which refers to the absence of a largely unrestricted arms race. And to grasp how arms control might help constrain an arms race, we need to take a look at the security dilemma.

<LectureVideo smil="/lu01/HSFK-PC_LU01-CH02_16a_250404.smil" provider="video-stream">

  The security dilemma, sometimes also called the ‘spiral model’, rests on three basic assumptions. The first (neo-realist) assumption is that states are the principal actors in international politics. The second assumption is that the international system is what realists call an anarchic system, meaning that there is no central authority such as a world government or a world police which could guarantee security in the international system. Experts call this the ‘9-1-1 problem’: If a state is attacked, it cannot call the police because a world police does not exist. The third assumption is that states can never be sure about other states’ intentions – even if another state is in fact perfectly benign, one can never be entirely sure about its true intentions. Consequently, as Grieco put it in 1988. ‘Today’s friend may be tomorrow’s enemy’.[^5]

  Since there is no central authority in world politics and one can never be sure about another state’s intentions, states rely on self-help to guarantee their own security and survival. That is why the international system is often referred to as a self-help system.

  However, self-help is not as straightforward as you might think. If state A builds up its military forces to ensure its own security, a neighbouring state B could misconstrue this benign arms build-up as a hostile act and decide that it must react to it. If the first state decides to increase its military spending once again, then an arms race might ensue. At best, such an arms race leads to the unnecessary accumulation of destructive and expensive weaponry. At worst, it might even lead to war.[^6]

  Arms control can help break this vicious cycle and ameliorate the security dilemma. It does so in two ways. Firstly, arms control measures often include quantitative or qualitative limitations on armament to constrain how far or in what direction an arms race might go.

  Not only does this reduce the political and economic cost of the arms race. It can also lower the likelihood of war if a certain category of weapons that is considered particularly destabilising – that is, weapons which may invite a state to strike first due to their real or perceived military advantages – is regulated.
  Secondly, arms control agreements frequently come with provisions that aim to increase transparency, thus diminishing the uncertainty about another state’s intentions and military capabilities.

### Non-proliferation
While arms control is usually concerned with restricting existing arsenals of weaponry both quantitatively and qualitatively, non-proliferation aims to limit the spread of certain weapons and weapons technologies, in particular but not exclusively nuclear weapons and nuclear technology, to other countries.
Non-proliferation also serves the three overarching goals of arms control, but in a somewhat more indirect manner. Take nuclear weapons as an example: The core assumption is that a world in which only a few countries possess nuclear weapons is safer for everyone because it decreases the likelihood that a state could try to upset the existing international order in a way that might eventually lead to a regional war escalating into a global nuclear conflict. But as can be seen in [Learning Unit 12](/lu-12/), there are other regimes where the ‘haves’ pledge not to export other conventional weapons technologies to the ‘have nots’.

Furthermore, non-proliferation helps to avert regional arms races as it seeks to prevent a situation in which one state acquires nuclear weapons and a rival in the neighbourhood feels compelled to catch up.

International non-proliferation initiatives have their roots in the 1950s and 1960s, when the United States and the Soviet Union joined forces to contain the global spread of nuclear weapons, recognising that it would be in their mutual interest to keep the number of nuclear weapon states as low as possible. One key motivation was to prevent West Germany from becoming a nuclear power. Eventually, US-Soviet collusion on nuclear non-proliferation resulted in the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT) and the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [(NPT, see LU05)](/lu-05/).
