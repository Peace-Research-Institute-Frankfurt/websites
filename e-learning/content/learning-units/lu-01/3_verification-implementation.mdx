## Verification

<LectureVideo smil="/lu01/HSFK-PC_LU01-CH05_16b_250409.smil" provider="video-stream">
  When it comes to formal arms control, ‘verification’ is one of the most prominent concepts. In general terms, it refers to the processes and mechanisms used to ensure that parties (usually states) comply with the terms of the respective arms control agreement. This usually includes monitoring (e.g. with satellites or seismic monitoring devices), inspections and visits by foreign inspectors (sometimes planned well in advance, sometimes spontaneous), data sharing with inspectors (which they can then compare with their own findings) and other measures to detect and prevent violations.

  In an ideal process, verification promotes trust and transparency between the signatories. It aims to provide confidence that all parties are fulfilling their commitments, that all parties are compliant and that no party is secretly violating the agreement. The aim of verification is therefore to help make arms control possible in the first place. It does so by protecting the states from having their willingness to cooperate exploited. By verifying whether the other side is adhering to the agreement they entered into, each side can engage in cooperation with peace of mind. However, even a very intrusive verification regime cannot  guarantee compliant behaviour of the other side with 100-percent certainty. That being said, at the very least, extensive verification measures can drive up the costs of secretly violating the agreement. But how much verification is feasible and acceptable? Visit the other learning units to see how the issue of verification is handled in the respective field.

  In general, verification walks a fine line between politically desirable transparency and politically undesirable espionage. Therefore, a minimum of trust is also necessary for verification.[^1]

  This means that even the most sophisticated and stringent verification measures will not create the trust necessary for arms control if the starting point is complete mistrust and the assumption that states would only enter into agreements in order to exploit them unilaterally. The findings of research on verification theory are therefore paradoxical. Intrusive, far-reaching verification measures can apparently be used when a certain relationship of trust already exists, i.e. when intrusive and far-reaching verification measures are actually no longer necessary. Conversely, such measures would in fact be important where they are least likely because there is insufficient trust to introduce them.

  Even if a base level of trust does exist, a number of other challenges make verification difficult. Some activities are difficult to detect, especially if they are deliberately hidden and the existing verification mechanisms intentionally undermined. Others are difficult to interpret, especially if dual-use technology is used and agreements are vague as to what activities are permitted or prohibited. Lastly, verification is expensive and requires the latest technologies to keep pace with innovation in weapons technology.

  States have developed a range of methods to overcome mistrust and enable verification. These include the use of national technical means (NTMs) for independent verification, e.g. through satellites or airborne sensors; an agreement to share reports and data; and on-site inspections to verify compliance on the ground. In some cases, international organisations were founded to ensure third-party verification, as in the case of the OPCW, IAEA and CTBTO. A relatively new idea is to engage civil society and use the invisible college of scholars and activists for societal verification. However, the restrictions civil society faces in some countries significantly limit their utility. Lastly, in some cases, states have decided to dispense with verification altogether, [e.g. in the area of biological weapons](/lu-03), because the effort would be entirely disproportionate to the result. It would simply not be possible to control all state and private facilities where biological weapons could be produced.

### Examples of verification mechanisms

<DetailsGroup numbered>
  <Details summary="On-site inspections">

    On-site inspections may include regularly scheduled routine inspections to verify compliance with treaty terms or unscheduled challenge inspections initiated upon suspicion of non-compliance. Baseline inspections establish a benchmark inventory or facility condition.

  </Details>
  <Details summary="Monitoring and surveillance">

    The use of various sensors in space, in the air, at sea and on land for monitoring and surveillance may include monitoring facilities and the movement of military assets from space with satellites, using seismic sensors to detect underground nuclear tests and radiation detectors to identify unauthorised nuclear activities or materials.

  </Details>
  <Details summary="Data exchanges and notifications">

    Declarations provide detailed inventories of weapons, facilities and delivery systems, while advance notifications supply information about missile tests, troop movements or military exercises. Moreover, annual compliance reports can include regular updates on compliance and changes to military inventories.

  </Details>
  <Details summary="Remote monitoring systems">

    Cameras and video surveillance can provide continuous video feeds from key facilities. This may be combined with environmental sampling, which involves analysing air, water or soil for traces of prohibited activities. The International Atomic Energy Organization (IAEO), for example, uses cameras to monitor nuclear facilities around the globe.

  <Details summary="Destruction and dismantling verification">

    Destruction and dismantling verification may include observing the physical dismantling of weapons or facilities, maintaining and verifying documentation of destroyed systems and ensuring that dismantled components cannot be repurposed.

## Implementation

Agreements on arms control measures are one thing, but implementing them is quite another. While the implementation of bilateral arms control is monitored and verified by opponents, the monitoring and verification of multilateral agreements often requires more complex institutional structures. Review conferences and conferences of states parties provide such a structure by discussing implementation on a regular basis. Their main function is to periodically focus public and diplomatic attention on the operation of a particular arms control regime.

However, such conferences also hold the potential for conflict when poor implementation is criticised and the continued existence of the regime is called into question. Since 1975, the NPT Review Conferences have been the venue for growing criticism levelled by the non-nuclear weapon states at the nuclear weapon states for not fulfilling their disarmament obligation under Article 6 of the NPT. Growing frustration with the lack of implementation ultimately led to the adoption of the TPNW by the UN General Assembly. NPT Review Conferences are a good example of how formal review conferences can become stuck in established patterns and lose their ability to generate solutions to implementation problems. As long as states continue to be interested in cooperation, however, review conferences and conferences of state parties can stabilise the implementation of arms control agreements.
