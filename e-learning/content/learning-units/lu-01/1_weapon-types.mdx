Although some people might oppose all forms of weapons, even if they are used for legitimate self-defence, arms control is often based on the idea that specific types of weaponry are especially abhorrent, dangerous or – in arms control parlance – destabilising. These weapons therefore necessitate some form of control or even elimination. However, in order to determine which types are a particularly high risk for international peace and security, at least some knowledge about weapons is required.

So, how can we categorise different types of weapons?

One of the most fundamental distinctions is between conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction, or WMDs, with the latter being ‘capable of a high order of destruction or causing mass casualties’, according to the [U.S. Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms](LU01_E2_inhalte_grafiken_24022025_9_mm.svg). Weapons of mass destruction include nuclear, radiological, chemical and biological weapons (see Learning Units [2](/lu-02/), [3](/lu-02/) and [4](/lu-02/)). We discuss the different types of WMD in more detail below.

Conventional weapons encompass a much wider scope of different weapon systems. The United Nations Register of Conventional Arms, for example, includes seven different categories of conventional weapons.

Small arms and light weapons (SALWs, [see LU10](/lu-10/)), which include rifles, heavy machine guns, anti-tank weapons and portable missile launchers, are an additional category.

Many, although not all weapon systems can be further divided into subcomponents, all of which may be subject to control. This is best illustrated by looking at the category of missiles and missile launchers [(see Learning Unit 7 for more details)](/lu-07). The warhead, also called the ‘armament section’ is a crucial component of the missile and responsible for killing the target.

The warhead can be equipped with various payloads, including conventional explosives, a nuclear physics package in the case of a nuclear weapon, or chemical and biological warfare agents.

The missile carries the warhead to its designated target. This is why missiles are often referred to as ‘delivery vehicles’. If a missile carries multiple warheads, it also contains what is known as a ‘bus’, which is propelled into space by the missile to release the warheads. Lastly, a missile must be fired from some sort of launcher, which can be either stationary or mobile, as in a missile silo or a mobile missile launcher. Each type of weapon and each subcomponent can be subject to various forms of arms control.

## Weapons of mass destruction

<LectureVideo smil="/lu01/HSFK-PC_LU01-CH04_16b_250408.smil" provider="video-stream">

  There are many definitions of the term ‘weapons of mass destruction‘, or WMD, that is, but the authorative one was provided by a committee of the United Nations in as early as 1948.[^1]

  This definition states that WMD are:

  <Quote cite='Commission on Conventional Armaments (CCA), UN document S/C.3/32/Rev.1, August 1948, as quoted in UN, Office of Public Information, The United Nations and Disarmament, 1945–1965, UN Publication 67.I.8, 28'>

    …atomic explosive weapons, radio active material weapons, lethal chemical and biological weapons, and any weapons developed in the future which have characteristics comparable in destructive effect to those of the atomic bomb or other weapons mentioned above.
  </Quote>


  As this definition shows, we can distinguish between four types of WMD.

  <DetailsGroup>
    <Details summary="Nuclear weapons">

      Nuclear weapons use nuclear fission, as seen in atomic bombs, or nuclear fusion, which powers thermonuclear weapons to produce blast, heat, radiation and radioactive fallout. All of these effects cause widespread destruction and significant casualties.

    </Details>
    <Details summary="Radiological weapons">

      Radiological weapons use conventional explosives to disperse radioactive material in order to cause radiation sickness, which, depending on the radiation exposure, can be fatal. Radiological weapons do not involve nuclear fission or nuclear fusion.

    </Details>
    <Details summary="Chemical weapons">

      Chemical weapons are substances designed for military use, capable of causing death, serious injury or incapacitation through their physiological effects. The term chemical weapon typically encompasses both the chemical agent itself and the munition employed to disperse it.

    </Details>
    <Details summary="Biological weapons">

      Biological weapons are living microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria or fungi that are released with the intent to cause disease in humans, animals or plants. Toxins which are derived from microorganisms are also considered biological weapons.

    </Details>
  </DetailsGroup>

  Although the term WMD is well established and widely used today, it is not without its critics. As some scholars have argued, neither chemical nor biological weapons come close to the destructiveness of nuclear weapons. Moreover, states can defend against both chemical and biological attacks by issuing protective gear and containing the spread of biological agents through public health measures, as could be witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Likewise, doctors and medical personnel can treat victims of biological attacks. In this sense, the only true weapon of mass destruction are nuclear weapons.[^2]

  Preventing the use of WMDs has received significant political attention. But in fact, they are not the weapons that cause most of the harm in conflicts worldwide. As the former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan argued in 2000:

  <Quote cite='Annan, Kofi. 2000. We the Peoples: The Role of the United Nations in the Twenty-first Century '>

    In terms of the carnage they cause, small arms, indeed, could well be described as “weapons of mass destruction”.[^3]
  </Quote>

  As a result, some even go so far to call small arms and light weapons the real weapons of mass destruction.

## Conventional weapons

In contrast to weapons of mass destruction, conventional weapons are used extensively in armed conflict around the globe. You can find more information about some of the most commonly used conventional warheads below.

<DetailsGroup>
  <Details summary="Blast fragmentation warheads">

    The majority of artillery shells and aircraft-delivered bombs utilise blast fragmentation warheads. These warheads consist of a metal casing filled with explosives, generating substantial shrapnel in addition to the blast wave.

  </Details>
  <Details summary="High-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads">

    Most anti-tank guided weapons are equipped with high-explosive anti-tank warheads. These warheads feature a specifically shaped explosive known as a shaped charge which, upon detonation, generates a high-velocity metal jet capable of penetrating even the thickest armour.

  </Details>
  <Details summary="Thermobaric warheads">

    Thermobaric warheads are particularly devastating when used against enclosed structures like caves or complexes with multiple rooms. Typically, they comprise two charges: the first disperses an aerosol, composed of fuel or fine metal particles, while the second ignites it. This sequence results in a sustained blast wave, as the ensuing explosion consumes much of the available oxygen in the surrounding area.

  </Details>
  <Details summary="Cluster munitions">

    Cluster munitions are intended to inflict damage across expansive areas. Essentially canisters, they disperse smaller submunitions, often referred to as bomblets, which target enemy troops or vehicles on the battlefield. However, due to the high dud rate of many cluster munitions, these bomblets frequently remain unexploded on the ground, posing long-term risks to civilians. Consequently, the use of cluster munitions is prohibited under the Convention on Cluster Munitions.

  </Details>
  <Details summary="Kinetic energy warheads">

    Kinetic energy warheads kill their targets only through kinetic energy – they do not contain any explosive charges. One of the most basic kinetic energy projectiles is a bullet fired by a pistol or rifle. However, kinetic energy warheads, also known as ‘hit-to-kill’, are commonly used in air and ballistic missile defence as well.

  </Details>
</DetailsGroup>

Even though all of these warheads are conventional, they still result in significant levels of destruction – especially if used in urban terrain.

## Emerging disruptive technologies
In contemporary discussions about weapons technology, emerging disruptive technologies [(EDT, see LU15 for more information)](/lu-15/) are gaining more and more prominence. This umbrella term describes a number of technologies, many of which are still in development, that have the potential to affect the international balance of power and transform the way that wars will be fought in the future. However, precisely because they are still in the development phase, it is often unclear whether and to what extent their potential can be realised.


Some examples of emerging technologies are:

<DetailsGroup>
  <Details summary="Artificial intelligence (AI)">

    Artificial intelligence could be used in autonomous weapon systems and battle management systems, thereby increasing the speed of warfare beyond meaningful human control.

  </Details>
  <Details summary="Quantum technology">

    Quantum computers could provide their users with powerful code-breaking capabilities to decrypt enemy communications. Quantum sensors could be used to detect submarines.

  </Details>
  <Details summary="Directed energy weapons">

    Directed energy weapons can be used to affect a target without relying on a projectile. One example is laser technology, which could improve air and ballistic missile defence.

  </Details>
  <Details summary="Synthetic biology">

    Synthetic biology could be used to develop novel materials for military applications and biofuels, as well as to improve medical treatments.

  </Details>
</DetailsGroup>

You can find more examples of EDTs in [Learning Unit 15](/lu-15).

As you can see, not all emerging disruptive technologies are weapons. However, even those that are not could still have a significant impact on international affairs. What is more, EDTs pose a special challenge to arms control because they are often intangible and thus cannot be constrained in the same way as weapons of mass destruction or conventional weapons.

In the next section, you will learn more about the different forms of arms control and how various types of weapons can be controlled.
