What makes “cyber” special compared to the conventional realms of land, sea, air and space? One of the most important differences is how a “cyber weapon” actually works.

A conventional kinetic weapon causes damage by directing energy (such as heat, pressure or electromagnetic pulse), against a structure, a human body or electronic equipment. In contrast, a cyber tool has to work from the inside of its target – that is getting illegitimate software code to work on someone else’s computer. Access to the computer is therefore key.

This can be done either by so-called “brute force” – trying endless name/password combinations to get access – or by using knowledge about the relevant system, its weaknesses and potential exploits. If, for example, a video player is used which is known to sometimes store data in dedicated areas of the computer’s memory reserved for executable code, malformed inputs, that is specifically prepared – or weaponized – files, can force such a “buffer overflow” and execute malicious code. Usually this cannot be done “on the fly” – notwithstanding what Hollywood movies suggest – but requires a user to interact with the file: watch a prepared video, visit a specific website – etc. All necessary steps for a successful attack, from reconnaissance to achieving the objective, are described by the so-called “kill chain”, which will be presented later in the unit.

Another significant distinction between kinetic- and cyberattacks is that it is significantly harder to predict the damage caused by the weapon. In contrast to a missile, mortar or machine gun, many cyber weapons can replicate themselves, infecting third-party computers, and spreading much like a bioweapon agent.

Finally, there is the so-called “attribution problem”. In the cyber realm, it may be impossible to know for sure who was behind an incident. IP-addresses can be masked and the origin of an attack can be disguised. Even if the source of an incident or attack is traced back to a certain country, city or building, this would not necessarily give away the perpetrator. A malicious group from state A could, for example, attack state B using public WiFi in state C.

But this is not all. If attribution is problematic or even impossible, well-established military concepts like retaliation and deterrence cannot work, rendering old-fashioned military answers to stability problems obsolete. States have reacted in different ways to these new challenges.

In October 2012, then US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta publicly announced: “Potential aggressors should be aware that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions that may try to harm America”. Whether this claim is well founded or a mere bluff is unclear, but potential attackers might be thinking twice now – surely his intent.

Today, attribution usually rests on the combination of tools including digital forensics and classical intelligence work. If, for example, a particular building has been identified as the source of a constant attack, old-fashioned observation kicks in.

One of the often-heard buzzwords in this context is “autonomous hack-back”. The idea is that an automated system which detects an intrusion attempt will follow the datastream back to its source and cause damage to the attackers system. While this has a high potential for sudden escalation, of course, it is often overlooked that a hackback only works if the institution hacking back has prior knowledge about the attacker’s system.

## The Cyber Kill Chain

The arms manufacturer Lockheed Martin has developed the concept of the “Cyber Kill Chain”, a model of how a cyberintrusion works.

Today, there are many variants of the “kill chain” and we present a rather consolidated version here. What is important, however, is that the cyber kill chain dictates that for any form of counter attack in the case of an attack, the defender needs prior knowledge of the attacker’s system. So even if a state has no intention of offensive cyberoperations, it has to actively look for weak spots in the computer systems of potential adversaries.

### 1: Reconnaissance and Weaponization

After careful reconnaissance of the potential victim, a “weaponized” file is created, aiming at a specific exploit. While looking harmless (e.g. .pdf, .mp4 or .jpg), the file contains malicious code.

### 2: Delivery and Exploitation

The file is delivered to the target (e.g. by a forged email) and run, thereby exploiting the preselected vulberability of the targeted system.

### 3: Privilege Escalatation

The malicious code installs a “beachhead” granting access to the system. From this beachhead, the intruder aims for privilege escalation, for example administrator instead of user rights.

### 4: Achieving Objectives

Finally, after gaining command and control the intruder can achieve his or her objective, be it data exfiltration, data destruction, data manipulation or simply switching off the system.

In a military context, for example, an intruder could place sleeping executable code in a system, reacting to specific circumstances.

### Zero Day Exploits

Updates and patches will of course interrupt the kill chain, so intelligence agencies and military actors are always looking for new and unknown weak spots, so-called zero-day exploits.

There is a black market for zero day exploits which have been known to the general public. Complex cyber operations, like Stuxnet, are based on several zero-day exploits.

## The Problems of Arms Control in Cyberspace

This video debates:

- why arms control is particularly difficult in the cyber realm
- what kind of agreements have been made so far
- whether soft norms or legally binding treaties should be aimed for
- whether confidence building measures could make a difference

One of the most important questions regarding cyber weapons has been whether – and if so, how – arms control measures can be applied in the cyber realm. According to many arms control experts, the “gold standard” of arms control usually entails, first, a legally binding treaty, second, restricting a clearly and detailed defined subject and, third, ensuring compliance through an effective yet non-intrusive verification regime. Unfortunately, it is significantly harder to archive this in cyberspace than in other more classical military realms.

First, it is hard for states to agree on what to regulate or ban to begin with. Well established arms control concepts like “effector” or “carrier” – introduced in learning unit one – are hard to apply. Second, given the fast pace of technological developments in information technology, detailed arms control agreements might always be behind current technological trends. Third, by their very nature, cyber weapons are basically nothing but software code and can be programmed, stored on or released from any computer or mobile device. In consequence, hiding malicious code or changing code on the fly is extremely easy. This means that verification in the arms control sense is a real challenge, and trust is way harder to archive.

Given these problems, two other paths are currently in the limelight: One is to focus on voluntary normative restraints rather than legally binding treaties, the other is to implement so-called transparency and confidence building measures, or CBMs. Both approaches have pros and cons.

CBMs offer transparency and information exchange on a voluntary basis but do not restrict actors in the way arms controllers would like. They are relatively easy to achieve. The OSCE member states, for instance, have agreed on certain CBMs to defuse emerging tensions, for example setting up official contact points. And in 2013, Russia and the United States established a cyber hotline to inform each other about relevant cyber instances.

In contrast to CBMs, normative restraints or simply “norms” “reflect the international community’s expectations, set standards for responsible State behaviour and allow the international community to assess the activities and intentions of States“, as the report of the 2015 UN Group of Governmental Experts explains.

The Russian Federation first suggested developing behavioural norms in a draft proposal to “regulate” “Information Warfare” and its subcomponent cyberwarfare in 1998. Russia tried to bind the technologically more advanced US to international norms, but with no result. Since then, however, some international norms on responsible state behaviour in the cyber realm seem to have emerged, like “do not allow your territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using information technology” or “do not intentionally damage critical infrastructures”.

Interestingly enough, not only states have acted as norm entrepreneurs, but also private business and intelligence agencies. But norms can be violated and the level of compliance is dependent on the internalization of the norm by all actors. Some experts, however, still think that at least some forms of harder arms control might be able to be applied to military cyber preparations and operations.

One approach could be a binding international definition of what constitutes a cyber weapon that is strongly tied to technical aspects and can be assessed before its actual usage. A second venture would be the establishment of technical approaches to control or oversee military IT networks to detect the application of weaponized code. None of these tools could prevent covert state activities (a burden that arms control has always had to carry) – but they can create important steps towards more effective cyber verification regimes.

## Difficulties of Classical Arms Control in Cyberspace

### What to control?

In a classical arms control agreement, participating parties exactly define what “effector” or “carrier” falls under the treaty. These terms are less clear in the cyber realm.

### The Verification Problem

Solid verification is one of the important pillars of successful arms control agreements. However, how to verify complex software without being too intrusive is a problem yet to be solved. This also includes updates.

### Different Classes of Actors

Traditionally, the relevant actors in arms control are nation states. Not much thought has been given to the question of how non-state actors can be included into formal arms control agreements.

### The Rapid Technological Development

Even if the first problem, what to control, could be solved, the rapid technological development might render all agreements useless after a very short time.

### The Attribution Problem

The attribution problem presented before makes it tricky or even impossible to identify breaches in case of attacks.

### Scope

If a classical arms control agreement could be found, who should be a member? Should it only include the major cyber powers or should it be as universal as possible?

|           | Treaties                                                                                                                                                | Norms                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Positives | Clearer understanding of do’s and don’ts higher authenticity of forensic material - states still main actors in more dangerous forms of cyber-incidents | easier to achieve than treaties- involvement of actors beyond the state: “norm-entrepreneurs”- relevant legal basis has to be established as a norm anyway- ignorant to verification problems   |
| Negatives | harder to achieve- problematic verification- take very long to negotiate- unrealistic, at least at the moment                                           | violations hard to attribute …- … or no credible attribution- different interpretations possible- How deep is the internalization?- frustration when violated- no punishment for non-compliance |

### Assessment

- Norms seem achievable at the moment, treaties not so much.
- Who will be future norm-entrepreneurs? States? NGOs? Private Companies? Even intelligence agencies?
- Can norms be a the stepping stone towards legally binding treaties? At least when supported by (voluntary) Confidence Building Measures (CBMs)?

## What Norms? Cybernorms and CBMs in the 2015 UN GGE Report

So far, the [2015 UN GGE report](https://nonproliferation-elearning.eu/learningunits/cyber/vid/lu19_vl2-2.vtt) has been the last report unanimously accepted by all experts involved, focusing on relevant norms in the cyberrealm (see page 13 for more details on UN GGE).

The report states:

<Quote type="document" cite="United Nations A/70/174, p.7">
  norms reflect the international community’s expectations, set standards for responsible State behaviour and allow the international community to
  assess the activities and intentions of States”
</Quote>

According to the 2015 UN GGE report, states behaving responsibly should:

- not allow “their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs” (p.8)
- “not conduct or support ICT activity that … intentionally damages critical infrastructure” (p.2)
- respect human rights on the internet and the right to privacy in the digital age (p.8)
- “increase stability and security in the use of ICTs” and prevent harmful practices (p.7)
- “consider all relevant information” in case of ICT incidents (p.7)
- “consider how best to cooperate to exchange information” (p.8)
- “prosecute terrorist and criminal use of ICTs” (p.8)
- “take appropriate measures to protect their critical infrastructure” (p.8)
- respond to “requests for assistance” by other states (p.8)
- “encourage responsible reporting of ICT vulnerabilities and share remedies” (p.8)

The 2015 report also contains recommendations for voluntary confidence building measures:

- identification of “points of contact” for cases of “serious ITC incidents” (p.9)
- development “of and support for bilateral, regional, subregional and multilateral consultations” (p.9)
- “Encouraging …. transparency at the bilateral, subregional, regional and multilateral levels” (p.9)
- provision of “national views of categories of infrastructure that they consider critical and national efforts to protect them” (p.9)
- additional “confidence-building measures that would strengthen cooperation on a bilateral, subregional, regional and multilateral basis” (p.9)

## New Actors, New Interests, New Stakeholders?

Traditionally, norms regulating the field of information and telecommunications have been set by state actors. First initiatives were, for example, brought forward by Russia before the turn of the Millenium.

More recently, however, new actors have joined the field, for a variety of reasons.
In a recent and widely cited publication by [Illina Georgieva](https://pariscall.international/en/principles), the author argues that

<Quote type="document" cite="Georgieva 2020: 33">
  security and intelligence agencies have become major actors in the cybersecurity landscape
</Quote>

Just with their actions, these agencies are setting norms for appropriate, or at least accepted behavior, for the international community, sometimes in conflict with other, more formal normative regulations.

Other actors which have become more active, and a cause for debate, have been private companies. Case in point is the so-called [“Paris Call for Trust and Security in cyberspace”](https://pariscall.international/en/), a cybersecurity agreement promoted by, amongst others, Microsoft, Facebook or Google. The call features 9 essential principles.

According to a Microsoft blog, the support for the call “demonstrated a widespread, global, multi-stakeholder consensus about acceptable behavior in cyberspace.”
In contrast to these private companies, the US government refrained from endorsing the document.

It is obvious, however, that companies did not push the call for altruistic reasons, but because cyber incidents are a threat to their core business models.

Given their interest and often enormous resources, we will see the shift from lobbying their national governments to actually promoting an agreement together with foreign governments probably more often in the future.

## Cyber-Related Agreements Throughout the Years

After a slow start in the 90s and early 2000s, international agreements between states regarding cyberspace have become more common in the last decade. These agreements have often been at the regional (or alliance) level with recent efforts to establish international norms across the entire international community. In most cases, the agreements simply reaffirm the position that international law should apply in cyberspace. The establishment and enforcement of cyber norms are still in the making. This timeline presents an overview of the various cyber-related agreements from the last two decades.
