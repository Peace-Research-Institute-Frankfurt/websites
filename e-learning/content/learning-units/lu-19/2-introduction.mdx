## Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity has become one of the buzzwords of our time. On a very general level, it describes all measures and practices protecting and defending computer networks, servers, computers – basically all computerized items, e.g. modern cars, planes, smart homes – from infiltration to hostile takeover.

Cybersecurity also includes setting up processes and making decisions, e.g. about access rights, or planning for the – hopefully unlikely – case of a disaster, that is a severe security breach with or without the loss of data. The basic aim would be to continue work with as few restrictions as possible and be “resilient”.

Finally, cybersecurity also includes the training of users in such things, for example, as preventing posting passwords on the screen for everyone to see.

Depending on the source, roughly 50 to 90 percent of all cyber incidents can be attributed to uninformed or untrained staff.

In some cases, cybersecurity means monitoring networks in real time, in other cases it focuses on checking applications for glitches in the design phase before release or patching them afterwards. It can mean the protection of data from manipulation or deletion.

## From Cybersecurity to “Cyberwar”

Malware attacks, or intrusions, in civilian as well as military networks often share the same tools. Overall cybersecurity is relevant for private users, businesses and scientific institutions, and government agencies such as ministries, executive bodies and the military.

Cybersecurity is thus essential to guarantee that normal civilian life and business continue, it is the defensive side of cyberoperations.

While we will cover some aspects of civilian cybersecurity in this learning unit, the focus is on the military use of cybertools as a means to influence a conflict in one’s direction – or the offensive side, if you will.

We will look at different forms of malicious cyberoperations, with a clear focus on the military use of cybertools. While many would use the word cyberwarfare in that context, using the term “cyberwar” is not without problems.

## Malicious Cyberoperations – a Taxonomy

This video ...

- explains why it is hard to find a definition for cyberattacks and cyberwar
- discusses why the word “war” might be misplaced in relation to the cyber-realm most of the time
- introduces different forms of cyber incidents
- distinguishes between cyber operations and information operations in the cyber space

<LectureVideo smil="lu19/lu19_vl1-1.smil" subtitles="https://nonproliferation-elearning.eu/learningunits/cyber/vid/lu19_vl1-1.vtt" provider="video-stream">

In 1993, John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt published a seminal article titled “Cyberwar is coming!” – and they put an exclamation mark at the end. Many observers were sceptical at that time and thought this to be an exaggeration – a science-fiction fantasy.

18 years later, in 2011, the US Department of Defense upgraded cyberspace to the status of a so called “operational domain”, placing cyber on the same level as land, sea, air and space. Concurrently, in 2012 Thomas Rid declared “Cyber War Will Not Take Place”, a perspective he has reiterated in several texts until today.

Unfortunately, internationally agreed definitions for what actually constitutes a cyberwar are still lacking. When political scientists talk about war, they usually are guided by definitions like the one by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, which defines war as “a state-based conflict or dyad which reaches at least 1000 battle-related deaths in a specific calendar year.” As we will see later, there has not been any cyber-related incident matching this definition.

But there is a tendency to exaggerate cyberthreats by unknowingly or knowingly using imprecise vocabulary. Especially the media, but also some decision makers, routinely use the term cyberwar for any unfriendly act against one’s state information technology infrastructure. It is therefore important to differentiate between different forms of malicious cyber operations.

The probably most harmless form is called “hacktivism”. Examples would be the defacement of government websites, changing text or visual elements, or so-called Distributed Denial of Service attacks, where a website is overwhelmed by a flood of simultaneous server requests, disrupting normal functionality.

Another widespread form of non-state cyber activity is “cybercrime”. Everything with a clear criminal intention, including ransomware, that is the encryption of a victim’s hard drive to demand ransom or phishing for passwords to commit identity theft, falls into this category.

A third form of cyber operation is “cyberespionage”, the collection of security relevant data by state actors, including, for example, blue prints of new weapon systems or “kompromat”, that is compromising information suited for blackmail.

A fourth form is “cyberterrorism”, for example an attack against critical infrastructure like a traffic-light system or a nuclear power plant with the aim of causing uncertainty, fear and havoc, usually inflicting physical destruction and human casualties.

Finally, I would reserve the term “cyberwar” for a large-scale attack against military targets with the aim of supporting classical military kinetic attacks. From this perspective, a cyberwar is always supporting a comprehensive conventional military operation or attack. We will debate this in more detail when we look at the legal side of cyber operations.

## Cyber Incidents in the Physical World so far (Selection)

<Timeline>
  <Event date="2007" title="Estonia" collapsed>

In late April 2007, many Estonian websites, including those of banks and governmental institutions, were flooded with denial-of-service attacks from millions of computers captured in 75 countries for several days. Estonia suspected that Russia was behind the attack or had at least assisted Russian ‘patriotic hackers’ as retaliation for the relocation of a Soviet-era grave marker.

However, these allegations could never be proven. The new NATO member Estonia turned to its Alliance partners for help, citing Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. However, after some deliberation the other NATO members concluded that collective defense as stated by Article 5 was not applicable, based on the same arguments fleshed out in the Tallinn Manual a few years later.

  <Event date="2007" title="Syria: Operation Orchard" collapsed>

Shortly after midnight of September 6, 2007, fighter jets believed to belong to the Israeli Air Force (IAF) attacked a suspected nuclear reactor facility in Syria, destroying the site completely. According to news sources, Israeli intelligence had learned about the complex from a spying software planted on the computer of a senior Syrian government official.

In addition, experts suggested that the Syrian air defence had been spoofed with the help of a US-developed software called 'Suter'. This software made the Syrian systems believe that there was nothing out there to defend against. However, neither the bombing nor the use of cyber means has been confirmed.

  </Event>
  <Event date="2010" title="Iran" collapsed>

In 2010 security experts discovered a very sophisticated piece of malware, utilizing four previously unknown vulnerabilities as well as stolen security certificates. Instead of causing indiscriminate harm, this software, ‘Stuxnet’, was after something very special: a specific program controlling Siemens industrial hardware.

Coincidently, it was the exact software used for the enrichment centrifuges in Iran’s highly controversial nuclear enrichment plant in Natanz. When the software reached Natanz it subtly altered the rotation speed of the centrifuges, not enough to be noticed, but enough to damage and break them eventually. It is believed that ‘Stuxnet’ was jointly programmed by Israeli and American experts to delay the Iranian nuclear program.

  </Event>

  <Event date="2015" title="Germany: Attack on the German Bundestag" collapsed>

In 2015 a group of hackers penetrated the internal net of the German Bundestag, the German parliament, potentially getting hold of emails and confidential documents. German newspapers described the hack as a “spectacular intelligence operation”. Only discovered by sheer chance, the offices of at least 16 MPs were compromised, including the Chancellor’s (excepting the office at the Chancellery) and an unknown amount of information was retrieved.

After a comprehensive analysis, the German government was convinced that a branch of Russia’s military intelligence agency with the nickname “Fancy Bear” was behind the attack. The penetration had been initiated by an email allegedly sent by the UN, containing a manipulated link, thereby fooling the Bundestag’s firewall, ultimately installing a trojan on the respective computers. In 2020 chancellor Merkel reiterated that “she had ‘hard evidence’” for Russia’s responsibility.

  </Event>

<Event date="2017" title="WannaCry, NotPetya" collapsed>
  WannaCry is a malware which started spreading in May 2017 and infected more than 230.000 Windows-based PCs in 150 countries on one day. It is a ransomware which, once activated, encrypts the hard drive and offers the user decryption keys in exchange for money. Victims of WannaCry included many public services and hospitals.

Another malware, called NoPetya, also seemingly ransomware, started spreading a month later, again targeting Windows based systems. This virus also spread by its own. In contrast to classical ransomware, it destroyed infected hard drive contents without a chance of recovery.

As the attack first targeted Ukraine, before spreading worldwide, many experts, as well as the governments of Ukraine, the US and the UK, suspected the source of NoPetya to be Russia. Russia rejected these allegations, pointing towards its own high number of infections.

</Event>

<Event date="2019" title="Iran" collapsed>
After the spectacular drone attack against a Saudi-Arabian refinery in September 2019, allegedly conducted by Houthi rebels with Iranian help, as well as Iranian attacks against oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, the US launched cyberattacks against Iranian intelligence groups believed to be involved in the original attacks.

In contrast to what the military calls “kinetic attacks” the US government believes that the online operations conducted stayed well below the threshold of war, but still sent a deterring signal. US officials were hinting that other systems had been penetrated as well – including Iranian missile launch systems - thereby sewing suspicion that the systems would actually work when needed.

## Does International Law apply in the Cyber Realm?

This video debates:

- whether international law applies to the cyber realm
- why the so-called Tallinn Manuals are the most important yet inofficial publications in the issue

<LectureVideo smil="lu19/lu19_vl1-2.smil" subtitles="https://nonproliferation-elearning.eu/learningunits/cyber/vid/lu19_vl1-2.vtt" provider="video-stream">

In the last video, we debated different forms of malicious cyber operations against a state’s IT infrastructure. This has been an interesting exercise in conceptualization. Yet what concerns states most in this context is whether a specific type of attack warrants military self-defence. This leads to an important question: Is international law applicable to cyber threats?

As early as 1998, the issue of cybersecurity was addressed by the UN General Assembly, based on a draft resolution by the Russian Federation. In 2003, the UN established a multinational Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on the issue of “Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security”. The question of the applicability of international law and international humanitarian law (IHL) was debated but contested, preventing consensus within the GGE on the issue and preventing a subsequent report. Until today, there have been six GGEs on the issue but only three agreed on a consensual report.

In 2013, the report by the third GGE was the first to confirm that international law, as well as the UN Charter, are applicable to the cyber realm. Interestingly enough, this was also the bottom line of another 2013 document, the so-called Tallinn Manual. The Estonia-based NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence had initiated this non-binding study on cyber-conflicts and international law by an international group of experts. While it is not an official NATO document, it is one of the most significant publications on cyber conflict and international law so far, also confirming that the classical rules of international law remain applicable to the cyber-realm.

Regarding self-defence, the group of experts concluded “that cyber operations alone might have the potential to cross the threshold of international armed conflict”. Notice that it says “might”. While states do not have to condone less severe cyber operations against themselves, in most cases their reactions have to be restricted, or proportionate to the attack. The Tallinn-Manual defines a cyberattack as a cyber operation, that “is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects”.

Given this definition, most of the cyber activities presented in the last video do not qualify as an attack in a legal sense. Even some forms of cyber-terrorism might not justify military self-defence, if, for example, they only cause substantial financial loss but not physical damage.

From the perspective of the Tallinn-Manual, cyberattacks have to match the effects of kinetic attacks in order to legitimize military self-defence. This position was reiterated in 2017, when Tallinn 2.0 was published, focusing not only on interstate war, but other forms of conflicts as well.

Today, however, the 2013 consensus seems to be under jeopardy again. While Western states stick to the Tallinn argument, other actors like China and Russia argue that only selected aspects of international law are applicable to the cyber realm. The debate is ongoing.

## The UN GGE Process and the 2015 Report

On the UN level, the issue of ‘developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security’ has been on the agenda since at least 1998, starting with a Russian initiative. Since then, annual reports have been sent by the Secretary-General to the General Assembly focusing on national views.

In addition, Groups of Governmental Experts (GGEs) met five times, starting in 2004, publishing three GGE-reports with and two without consensus. Currently the sixth GGE is meeting, probably presenting a concluding report in 2021.

Despite some problems, the GGE process has been widely acclaimed as an important forum to push the agenda of global cybersecurity.

One problem, which has haunted the GGEs so far, has been the disagreement about the scope of the issues to be debated.

While China and Russia do not want the debates to be limited to cyber operations as debated in chapter one, but also to cover what they understand as foreign information operations, Western states have traditionally seen this as a threat to a free exchange of ideas and an uncensored internet.

Of the GGE reports, many experts find the report published in 2015 the most important as all 20 members of the GGE agreed on important principles, like the protection of critical infrastructure, the exchange of information in the case of an incident and the refusal to let their territory be used for cyber attacks by state or non-state actors – amongst others.

Currently, however, some observers at least feel that the GGE process is ‘dead’. It will be important to see what the current GGE is able to achieve. Given the overall situation in arms control at the moment, it is doubtful whether a consensual report can be prepared.

## The Tallinn Manual and Tallinn Manual 2.0

<Figure src="tallinn-manual.jpg" size="leftMargin" alt="Green front cover of the Tallinn Manual 2.0" caption="The Tallinn Manual 2.0, relased in 2017." credit="© Cambridge University Press 2017, reproduced with permission of the licensor through PLSclear."/>

In addition to the UN GGEs, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence (in Tallinn, Estonia) established another group of 19 law experts to debate the applicability of international law to cyber operations.

As a product of NATO countries, it is not endorsed by other states like Russia or China, which would prefer a more UN oriented action or other initiatives. However, NATO stresses that the manual is not an official document but the opinion of independent experts.

<Quote cite="Tallinn Manual, Rule 30, p. 91-92" type="document">

A cyber attack is a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.

</Quote>

The first version of the manual was published in 2013. Its focus was on interstate conflicts. A revised version (Tallinn 2.0) was released in 2017, taking into account also other forms of cyberconflicts, for example between non-state actors and states.

However, the manual is very important as it was one of the first documents to conclude that international law was applicable to the cyber realm. In addition, it came up with a legal definition of cyberattacks.
