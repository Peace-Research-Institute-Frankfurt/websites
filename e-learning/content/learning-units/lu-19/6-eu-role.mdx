Before, we talked about major actors, like the US, China or Russia, as well as NATO. Now we will shift our perspective to the **European Union**. In this chapter, we outline **EU policies in cyber space** with a particular reference to its foreign, security and defence measures.

**First**, we provide an overview of the policy and institutional framework in which EU cyber security takes place. This section describes the purpose of EU cyber policies and how these have evolved since the first strategy in 2013. This section also describes the main EU actors with a role in cyber security, namely the “policymaking” and the “policy-support” institutions and agencies.

**Second**, we delve more deeply into EU cyber foreign, security and defence policies, which are mainly designed and implemented by three actors, namely the European Commission, the European External Action Service and the European Defence Agency, as well as member states. We firstly introduce cyber diplomacy measures that are aimed at deterring malicious actors by imposing countermeasures as well as actions that have sought to establish a rule-based cyber space environment.

**Finally**, we look at EU cyber defence policy and the ties with NATO, another institution with a fundamental role in European cyber defence.

## Cyber Security in the EU: Policy and Institutional Framework

In this video lecture, you will learn about:

- the **main “foundational” policies** of the European Union in the digital and cyber security field
- the **main institutions and organizations** with a prominent role in the making and execution of EU digital and cyber security policies

The European Union cyber security policy gained prominence in 2013 after the release of its first cyber security strategy **“An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace.”** There, the EU vowed to achieve **five main objectives**. I quote:

- achieving **cyber resilience**
- drastically **reducing cybercrime**
- **developing cyber defence policy** and capabilities related to the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP)
- develop the **industrial and technological resources** for cyber security
- establish a coherent **international cyberspace policy** for the European Union and promote core EU values

In light of the changing threat and technological landscape, as well as mixed progresses in its implementation, the strategy was renewed in 2017 with the EU Cybersecurity Package. In December **2020**, the EU released a **new cyber security strategy**, which contains interesting new features:

- an EU-wide **Cyber Shield** composed of Security Operations Centres that use AI and machine learning to detect early signals of imminent cyber attacks
- a **Joint Cyber Unit**, with the aim of bringing together the various cyber security communities for the purpose of collecting information and implementing swift responses to cyber threats
- European solutions for strengthening internet security globally, including a public EU **DNS Resolver Service**
- a **Programme of Action in the United Nations** to address international security in cyberspace

According to the **ENISA’s institutional map**, there are 22 actors that have a role in cyber security policy making, support and implementation in the EU. However, here we focus on those actors with a more pronounced role.

- Within the European Commission, several Directorates-General play an important role in developing cyber security, but the most central one is the DG for Communications Networks, Content and Technology **(DG CONNECT)**. It has competences in areas such as network and information security, 5G and electoral security.
- Within the European Council, the **Horizontal Working Party on Cyber Issues** was established in 2016. It gathers member states’ cyber ambassadors to discuss cyber security issues at the Council level.
- Within the European Parliament, the **Committee on Industry, Research And Energy** (ITRE) is the committee responsible for all discussions surrounding important EU-wide cyber security legislation. This includes, for example, the Network and Information Directive and the Cybersecurity Act.
- Finally the **European External Action Service**, the diplomatic service of the European Union, has an important role in promoting EU cyber diplomacy and in countering foreign disinformation.

When it comes to policy support and implementation, an important role is played by several actors:

- First, the **European Defence Agency**, EDA, which is the intergovernmental agency of the Council of the European Union devoted to defence issues. In the cyber realm, it is active in cyber defence capability development and in research and technology.
- Second, **ENISA**, which has tasks in areas such as the improvement of member states’ cybersecurity capabilities, the development of common responses to large-scale cross-border attacks and, since 2019, drawing up cybersecurity certification schemes.
- Finally, there is **EUROPOL**, and in particular the European Cybercrime Center (EC3), which has the lead in providing a law enforcement response to cybercrime.

## The NIS Directive and the Cyber Security Act

The Directive on security of network and information systems ([the NIS Directive](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis-transposition)) entered into force in August 2016 with the aim to increase the overall level of cybersecurity across the EU.

The main provisions of the directive are:

- identification of **operators of essential services** (i.e critical infrastructures)
- adoption of **cyber security national strategies**
- designation of **national competent authorities** and single point of contact
- establishment of Computer Security Incident Response Teams (**CSIRT**s)
- creation of the **Cooperation Group** among member states, ENISA and the Commission;
- Establishment of the EU CSIRTs network
- **security requirements and incident notification** for digital service providers

The Regulation on ENISA and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification **(the Cyber Security Act)** came into force in June 2019. The regulation ...

- ... gave a **new mandate to ENISA**, the EU agency for cyber security. The Agency was granted a permanent mandate and was given new tasks. In particular ENISA will have a key role in the establishment of a cyber security certification framework and in enhancing operational cooperation in the EU in the wake of EU-wide cyber security attacks.
- ... introduced a cyber security certification framework, intended as an EU-wide rule for cyber security certifications. Various schemes will specify the purpose and the security standards that should be met and the evaluation methodology.

## 5G Security in the EU: the 5G Toolbox

Against the backdrop of increasing fears related to the roll-out of foreign 5G technology in EU countries, in January 2020 the Commission released the **5G toolbox** with a view to provide a coordinated EU approach on the secure deployment of 5G.

The toolbox is addressed to member states, the Commission and the NIS cooperation group.

**Member states** should:

- strengthen **security requirements**
- apply **restrictions** to high risk suppliers
- **avoid any major dependency** on one supplier by adopting a multi-vendor strategy – especially, avoid major dependencies with high risk suppliers

The Commission, together with Member States, should:

- maintain a **diverse 5G supply chain** by making use of instruments such as the screening of potential foreign investments concerning 5G assets and further strengthening EU capacities in 5G and post-5G technologies
- develop **relevant EU certification schemes** so to ensure high level of security standardization

The NIS Cooperation Group should:

- review periodically the national and **EU risk assessments** on the security of 5G and post 5G networks
- monitor and evaluate the **implementation** of the toolbox
- coordinate and support the implementation of **supporting actions** aimed at the elaboration of guidance and exchange of best practices
- continue convergence of **technical and organizational security requirements** for network operators

## Tackling Terrorism Online: EU Approach on Preventing Terrorist Content Online

In 2018, the European Commission submitted a **proposal for the prevention of terrorist content online**. The proposal foresees:

- Terrorist content should be removed in one hour following a **removal order** by national authorities.
- Hosting services should take proactive measures to better **protect their services** and users from terrorist content.
- Service providers and member states should designate **24/7 points of contact** to follow up on removal orders.
- Safeguards to **handle complaints** related to erroneous removals should be created.
- Hosting services and member states will have to **report their actions** in transparency and accountability reports.
- Systematic failures to deal with removals result in **strong penalties**.

<Quote cite="Jean-Claude Juncker, State of the Union Address, Strasbourg, 2016">
  My Commission has prioritised security from day one – we criminalised terrorism and foreign fighters across the EU, we cracked down on the use of
  firearms and on terrorist financing, we worked with internet companies to get terrorist propaganda offline and we fought radicalisation in Europe’s
  schools and prisons. But there is more to be done.”

## EU Cyber Diplomacy and Capacity Building

The main goal of EU cyber diplomacy is to preserve a **free, open and secure** cyberspace, considered as the backbone of modern societies.

**Free** means promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedom in cyber space.

**Open** means a cyber space that is universal, affordable and whose access is equal to everyone.

**Secure** means having a safe environment in which cyber security measures are strengthened and cooperation is improved against cyber crime. This also means to increase resilience against cyber attacks through diplomatic and legal tools.

EU **cyber diplomacy’s main objective** is to make sure the main stakeholders around the world understand the importance of a free, open and secure cyber space. This is done through:

- protecting human rights and fundamental online freedoms
- enhancing competitiveness, growth and prosperity
- promoting sustainable digital development in third countries
- promoting a rule-based cyber space
- shaping rules of internet governance
- engaging with key partners.

In focus: **Cyber security capacity building**

The EU is an active player in building cyber security capacity both within its borders and outside. The main line of actions are of EU external capacity building are:

- supporting national cyber strategies
- increasing capacity of the justice systems
- increasing incident handling
- developing education, professional training and expertise as well as awareness
- applying a whole society approach.

In 2018, the EU published the **Operational Guidance for the EU’s International Cooperation on Cyber Capacity Building** and in 2019 funded a large-scale project called Cyber4Dev with a geographical focus on Africa and South Asia.

## EU Cyber Measures in Foreign, Security and Defence Policy

In this video lecture, you will learn about:

- the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox
- the Cyber Defence Policy Framework

<LectureVideo

The EU Cyber Diplomatic Toolbox and the Cyber Defence Policy Framework are two examples of Brussels' approach in the foreign security and defence aspects of cyber policy.

The **EU Cyber Diplomatic Toolbox** is a joint framework for an EU diplomatic response to malicious cyber activities. The framework was developed by member states and the EEAS and it is part of the European approach to conflict prevention and mitigation in the cyber arena. The Toolbox has the overall goal of **supporting a rule-based cyber space** through the **application of international law** and **promotion of responsible norms** of state behaviour. The framework was established to incorporate the full continuum of EU policies and instruments in case of major external cyber attacks, including, if necessary, restrictive measures.

The basis of this framework is the 2017 council conclusions and related implementing guidelines, the adoption of a horizontal cyber sanctions regime and the guidelines on “Coordinated Attribution at EU level” in 2019.

Importantly, the EU autonomous horizontal cyber sanctions regime establishes a **legal framework** to implement sanctions against cyber attacks (or attempted ones) whose effects constitute an external threat to the Union. Moreover, the framework underlines that attribution is a sovereign political decision of a member state and that not all measures foreseen in a hypothetical EU response require attribution.

The EU has been strengthening and improving the legal and operational foundation of this framework through several cyber exercises at the EU level, generally organized by ENISA.

The **EU Cyber Defence Policy Framework** is another EU framework dedicated to the advancement of EU cyber defence policy. The Framework was unveiled for the first time in 2014 and was later updated in 2018. The EDA and the EEAS are the main institutional actors behind it. The Framework recognizes **cyber space as the fifth domain of operations alongside land, sea, air and space**, whose protection and resilience is a necessary prerequisite for EU missions and operations (civilian and military) to succeed.

The Framework streamlines member states and EU efforts in six policy areas. The primary policy areas are the **development of cyber defence capabilities**, as well as the protection of the EU CSDP communication and information networks. In this regard, EU policy is similar and complementary to NATO cyber policy, as we have already explained in chapter 3. Other areas of action include training and exercises, research and technology, civil-military cooperation and international cooperation. Another revision of the Framework is expected by mid-2022.
