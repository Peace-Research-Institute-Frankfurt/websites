In the former two chapters, we covered concepts and definition of cyber war and how cyber conflict relates to international law. With this foundation, we can now move on to outline the **cyber defence strategies of major cyber international powers**, and show how cyber operations are often intertwined with broader information warfare strategies.

To do this, this chapter provides, first, a **framework to analyse countries’ cyber capabilities** through the taxonomy developed by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, **IISS**, in London.

Second, the chapter gives **an overview of the cyber policies** of two Western countries, namely the United Kingdom and the United States. An example of the evolution of Western strategic thinking in cyberspace are the UK **“Active Cyber Defence”** and the US **“Persistent Engagement”** policies. This section will also explore the role of and efforts by NATO and how national strategies are linked to the development of **NATO’s Cyber Defence Policy**.

Third, this chapter presents two other major players in cyberspace, **Russia** and **China**, and their modus operandi in this environment. This section will uncover how China uses cyberspace to advance its strategic objectives and how Russia devised an offensive cyber policy leading to destabilization in the West. It also unveils how these countries' cyber operations are part of a broader information strategy designed to weaken adversaries while keeping the level of conflict below the threshold that would trigger a direct military confrontation.

In sum, we will see that cyber operations have become an important part in the power-play of great powers.

## Cyber Military Capabilities: Which Countries Have Offensive or Defensive Doctrines?

This map shows the countries that have issued a **cyber security military doctrine**. Cyber military strategies typically explain governments’ views on issues such as offensive and defensive cyber operations and norms of behaviour in cyber space, among other things. They are usually produced by countries’ ministries of defence.

This map is based on the Global Cyber Strategies Index developed by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

The Index also includes a list of existing cyber strategies and laws by country and includes civilian and military cyber defence, digital content, privacy, critical infrastructures, e-commerce and cyber crime policies and regulatory frameworks.

## Measuring Cyber Defence Capabilities: the Methodology of the IISS I

For the first time in their [2020 edition of the Military Balance](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/tmib20/120/1), the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) has systematically outlined the **significant factors** that are useful to understand the **cyber military capabilities** of a country.

The Institute developed a **taxonomy** that focuses on **enablers and indicators**. These are derived from both the civilian sector and the armed forces ([see learning unit 12](/lu-12/)) and, because of that, the IISS notes the assessment of capabilities is more challenging as the lines between military and civilian capabilities, assets and operations are often blurred.

As of now, the IISS has made available only the taxonomy of cyber defence capabilities. In the near future, the institute will make available **national case studies** that will highlight national cyber military capabilities.

The IISS’s taxonomy is a useful **analytical framework** that puts in perspective what it means to have “cyber power” in the military realm and to draw comparisons among countries.

The next slide shows all **enablers and indicators** that make up a country’s cyber capability.

The main enablers are:

- strategy and doctrine
- command and control
- cyber empowerment and dependence
- cyber security and resilience
- global leadership in cyberspace
- military capability for cyber coercion

## Measuring Cyber Defence Capabilities: the Methodology of the IISS II

### Military Strategy/Doctrine – command and Control and Integration

- cyber defence related documents
- national- and command-level formations
- integrating bodies, such as national-security councils
- military cyber intelligence capacity

### Protection and Resilience of Military Networks

- automated joint-force cyber situational-awareness system; military computer emergency response teams (MIL CERTs)
- military cybersecurity exercises

### Military Capacity for Cyber Coercion

- decision-making framework
- recent reported used of cyber military forces

### Military Research and Development and Human Capacity

- research institutes (governments and military affiliated)
- military exercises in cyber defence or offensive actions
- active recruitment

### Extent of a Military Force's Digital Dependence/ Enabling

- space-based intelligence, ISTAR capability
- global operations and therefore reliance on global communications capabilities
- significant investments in digitally enabled technology
- ability to independently access and manoeuvre in space

/>

The [Cyber Operations Tracker](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/) of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) is a database of the publicly known state-sponsored incidents that have occurred since 2005.

The tracker includes only attacks that are perpetrated by a nation state or an entity that is affiliated with a nation state.

It includes **6 types of operations**: DDoS, espionage, defacement, data destruction, sabotage and doxing.

The main takeaways so far:

- 28 countries have been suspected of launching cyber operations.
- Countries have reacted by imposing sanctions and using indictments.
- State-sponsored cyber operations have caused power outages; as in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016.

## The Cyber Defence Policy of Selected Major Players: The US and the UK

These videos explain:

- the **United States cyber defence policy**, including the new concept of “Persistent Engagement”
- the **United Kingdom cyber security policy**, including new data on the “Active Cyber Defence” programme

Let us first look at the most important international actor, the **United States of America**. The United States’ Department of Defense released its **new cyber strategy** in 2018, which superseded the three-year-old version from 2015. The new strategy has **five main objectives**:

“**Ensuring** the Joint Force can achieve its missions in a contested cyberspace environment; **Strengthening** the Joint Force by conducting cyberspace operations that enhance US military advantages; **Defending** US critical infrastructure from malicious cyber activity that alone, or as part of a campaign, could cause a significant cyber incident; **Securing** DoD information and systems against malicious cyber activity, including DoD information and non-DoD-owned networks; **Expanding** DoD cyber cooperation with interagency, industry, and international partners.”

Despite the document being 3 years newer than the previous version, these objectives did not necessarily overhaul US military policy in cyberspace. Instead, the novelty of the document resides in the introduction of the concept of “persistent engagement”.

In contrast to the milder tones of the previous version, the document openly admits the US is in a long-term struggle with Iran and North Korea, but most notably China and Russia.

“We are engaged in a long-term strategic **competition with China and Russia**. These States have expanded that competition to include persistent campaigns in and through cyberspace that pose long-term strategic risk to the Nation as well as to our allies and partners. [...] Our focus will be on the States that can pose strategic threats to US prosperity and security, particularly China and Russia.”

The document states that because these actors are deterred to conventionally engage against the US, they are resorting to cyber instruments to challenge democratic processes or threaten critical infrastructures.

To confront this, the strategy argues that the **US Cyber Command** should be engaged in a **day-to-day competition**, what the new strategy refers to as “persistent engagement.” In this daily struggle, the US will work to collect intelligence, prepare capabilities and **defend forward**. In other words, it will attempt to disrupt foreign operations at its origins. These will also include all those operations that fall below the threshold of conflict, which is the usual environment where militaries are engaged.

“We will defend forward to **disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity** at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict [….] The Joint Force will employ offensive cyber capabilities and innovative concepts that allow for the use of cyberspace operations across the full spectrum of conflict.”

Some analysts believe that the new strategic posture does not make US policy offensive or escalatory in nature and make the example of “malware inoculation.” When the US Cyber Command goes on a hunt in an adversary's cyberspace and discover malign malware, they cooperate with other US departments and agencies by **exposing the malware** and make it public through **information sharing platforms** such as VirusTotal. Exposing the malware allow cyber defenders to patch vulnerabilities and increase resilience at home. Hence, malware inoculation does not involve disruptive cyber operations, but it is based on information sharing.

Other analysts, instead, think that a strategy of persistence presence might lead to mistakes, misperceptions, miscalculations and could also strategically fail if the US are unable to play the game hard enough to apply negative feedback.

In sum, the new document signals an important change in US cyber defence policy, an approach which is in stark contrast with UK one, the topic of discussion of our next episode.

In the last episode, we looked at the US cyber strategy more closely. The approach developed by the **UK government** is fairly different. It is called **“active cyber defence”** (ACD) and it is outlined in the “National Cyber Security Strategy 2016–2021”, published in November **2016**. The overall aim is to focus on those measures helping to strengthen a network or make a system more robust. In particular, the **objectives of this approach** are to:

- make the UK a much **harder target**
- **block malware communications** between victims and attackers
- **secure internet traffic** from malicious actors’ hijacking
- harden UK **critical infrastructures**
- **disrupt** the business model of attackers

To achieve these objectives, the UK government aims to work with the industry – especially **communication service providers** – to block malware attacks and prevent phishing activities that rely on domain spoofing. This will be done by deploying an **email verification system**. It will also scale up programmes within the **Government Communications Headquarters** (the GCHQ), the **Ministry of Defence**, the MoD, and the **National Crime Agency**, NCA, to disrupt malicious activities and promote security best practices through multi-stakeholder organizations such as the **Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers** (ICANN) and the **UN Internet Governance Forum** (IGF).

**According to government data**, since its launch Active Cyber Defence has reduced the UK's share of visible global phishing attacks by more than half (from 5.3% to 2.4%) and removed nearly 140,000 phishing sites hosted in the UK between September 2017 and August 2018.

**According to analysts**, the ACD programme has so far succeeded in reducing the incidence and the effect of low-level cybercrime and these measures should be extended beyond the public sector. Moreover, this **defensive approach** can be exported to likeminded countries that have a different approach from hacking back or other more escalatory policies.

Finally, if the ACD can effectively and efficiently operate and provide benefits at a low direct cost for citizens it may even be considered a public good.

## The Role of NATO

Allies are responsible to protect their own networks and systems, but **NATO supports** them by:

- sharing real time information
- deploying rapid-reaction cyber defence teams
- developing common targets to strengthen cyber capabilities
- organizing exercises such as Cyber Coalition

One important actor is the **NATO Communications and Information Agency** (NCIA) which provides cyber security services throughout NATO, including by handling and reporting incidents through its **NCIRC Technical Centre** in Belgium. It has a team of 200 experts.

In 2023, the new **Cyber Operations Centre** will be operational. Its tasks will include providing situational awareness to inform operations and coordinating the Alliance’s operations in cyberspace.

NATO argues:

<Quote cite="[nato.int](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_78170.htm)">

NATO and its Allies rely on strong and resilient cyber defences to fulfil the Alliance’s core tasks of collective defence, crisis management and cooperative security. The Alliance needs to be prepared to defend its networks and operations against the growing sophistication of the cyber threats and attacks it faces”

</Quote>

NATO has also defined its own **Cyber Defense Policy** which has been evolving since 2008.

The next slide gives an overview of NATO guiding principles in cyberspace, a chronology of the policy evolution as well as the main actors involved in the Alliance’s cyber decision-making.

## NATO Cyber Defence Policy

### Main Principles

- **Cyber defence** is part of NATO’s core task of collective defence.
- NATO affirmed that **international law** applies in cyberspace.
- NATO recognises that Allies stand to benefit from a **norms-based**, predictable and secure cyberspace.
- NATO’s main focus in cyber defence is to **protect its own networks** (including operations and missions) and **enhance resilience** across the Alliance.
- NATO reinforces its capabilities for **cyber education**, training and exercises.
- Allies are committed to enhancing **information-sharing** and **mutual assistance** in preventing, mitigating and recovering from cyberattacks.

For details, study [main principles on nato.int website](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_78170.htm)

### Policy Evolution

- **2008**: NATO approves first cyber policy
- **2011**: NATO approves second cyber policy
- **2014**: Wales Summit: new cyber policy and action plan
- **2016**: Warsaw Summit: NATO recognizes cyber space as a domain of operation and Cyber Defence Pledge
- **2017**: updated Cyber Defence Action Plan

- **Cyber Defence Committee** is the lead committee for political governance and cyber defence policy in general
- **NATO Cyber Defence Management Board** is responsible for coordinating cyber defence throughout NATO civilian and military bodies
- **NATO Consultation, Control and Command Board** consults on technical and implementation aspects of cyber defence
- **NATO Military Authorities** (NMA) and the **NATO Communications and Information Agency** (NCIA) identify operational requirements, acquisition, implementation and operating of NATO's cyber defence capabilities

## The Cyber Capabilities of Russia and China

### Russia

Russia has been investing significantly in developing tactics and tools to strengthen its cyber arsenal. According to some estimates, the Kremlin invests [$300 million per year and has a dedicated 1,000 strong cyber army](https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/reports/russia-china-cyber-offensive-latam-caribbean/).

Russian intelligence has been integrating network with information operations.

**Russia has used cyberspace to:**

- prepare for military kinetic operations
- engage in direct cyber operations as in Ukraine
- enable influence operations

### China

China’s cyber capabilities and skills are comparable to those of Russia.
China uses cyber capabilities in both peace and wartime to enhance its overall strategic objectives. Cyber is incorporated in the Diplomacy Information Military and Economic (DIME) operation spectrum.

**China has used cyberspace to:**

- advance diplomatic claims
- improve its own international perception
- bolster military capabilities
- advance economic interest

## Cyber Operations as a Tool in Influence Operations? Similarities and Differences in Russian and Chinese Approaches

### Differences: Russia

- **Geopolitics**: Russia is economically declining and aims at reversing the current international system.
- **Ethos**: Russia cares less about its international reputation.
- **Targets**: Russia targets the general population in deeply divided and polarized societies.
- **Narrative**: Russia supports the message of a declining, weak and divided West, discrediting its enemies.

Therefore, **Russia employs more aggressive techniques in the information environment**.

### Similarities

- Influence and information operations are “business as usual” in the conduct of domestic and foreign policy.
- Information operations are used domestically, albeit in two different ways: in Russia to manipulate, in China to censor.
- There is some degree of dysfunctionality in the administration and implementation of information and influence operations.
- China is adopting some techniques from Russian playbook in Taiwan and Hong Kong: it is using cross platforms and coordinated networks of fake and automated accounts to amplify its messages and with the overall goal to generate favourable offline effects.

### Differences: China

- **Geopolitics**: China is an emerging global power aiming at shaping the world with its own norms.
- **Ethos**: China wants to portray itself as a good global citizen.
- **Targets**: China mainly targets the “overseas Chinese community”.
- **Narrative**: China wants to promote the idea of a great, but non-threatening, China.

Therefore, **China is considered less risk averse in cyber operations** and does not engage in hack-and-leak operations like the Russian kompromat.
