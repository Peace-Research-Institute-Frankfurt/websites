## How to Watch and Read this Chapter

The **main objective** of this chapter is to give you an overview of the current threat posed by “cyber terrorists” to Critical National Infrastructures (CNI) and what measures can be put in place to mitigate their actions.

In the last chapter, we looked at state actors. This chapter now provides an **overview of cyber terrorism** and evaluates whether cyberterrorists pose a threat to critical national infrastructures, CNI.

**First**, as the concept of terrorism is not universally accepted, we attempt to provide a working definition for the purpose of this overview.

**Second**, in this chapter we consider the goals and tactics of major terrorist organizations employing Information Communication Technology to advance their goals, namely ISIL/Da’esh and al-Qaeda. It also assesses whether it would be possible for cyber terrorists to mount an effective online operation to dislocate Western critical national infrastructures. It points out that there is little evidence that terrorist organizations have the technological resources and the intellectual skills to deploy Stuxnet-like attacks.

**Finally**, this chapter offers an example of what kind of operations can be used to curb online terrorism in the context of a military operation. To get deeper into the operational aspect, it uses as a case study “Operation Glowing Symphony,” which was conducted by the US Cyber Command to disrupt ISIL network operations.

## Cyber Terrorism: a Working Definition

To date, there are no universally accepted definitions of cyber terrorism, as the concept of terrorism in itself is highly disputed at the international level. For example a rebel group targeting police forces in the context of an escalating civil conflict might be labelled as a “terrorist group” or a “liberation army” depending on the stakeholder’s perspective in the conflict.

There are however some **dictionary definitions**:

[Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cyberterrorism) defines cyber terrorism as: “terrorist activities intended to damage or disrupt vital computer systems”.

Similarly, the [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/cyberterrorism) defines it as: “the use of the internet to damage or destroy computer systems for political or other reasons”.

There are also **more elaborate definitions** as the one put forward by [Luiijf, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-800743-3.00002-5), where the author considers relevant:

“The use, making preparations for, or threat of action designed to cause a social order change, to create a climate of fear or intimidation …”

made with the intention to achieve any goal (political, religious, racial)

“… by affecting the integrity, confidentiality, and/or availability of information, information systems and networks, or by unauthorized actions …”

which should involve violence, serious injuries, damage to properties, risk to health and a serious breach of the social and political stability and cohesion of a country.

**This chapter uses the definition as proposed by** the [National Conference of State Legislatures](https://web.archive.org/web/20030110120948/http:/www.ncsl.org/programs/lis/CIP/cyberterrorism.htm):

<Quote type="document">
  The use of information technology by terrorist groups and individuals to further their agenda. This can include use of information technology to
  organize and execute attacks against networks, computer systems and telecommunications infrastructures, or for exchanging information or making
  threats electronically.”
</Quote>

Rather than defining the **act** this definition has the merit to restrict the concept of cyber terrorism to the **actors** (i.e. terrorist groups and individuals) who perform online actions to reach their goals.

This allows to achieve better conceptual clarity as a [list of individuals and entities associated with terrorist activities](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/sanctions/information) is updated by the United Nations.

## Terrorist Groups Using ICT: The Major Players

This video explains the strategic goals and tactics of major terrorist groups using ICT, including:

- **ISIL (Da'esh)**
- **al-Qaeda**

The **Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIL/Da’esh)** is a terrorist organization that gained global prominence in 2014 with the occupation of large swaths of territories in Iraq and Syria. After a military campaign led by an international coalition, ISIL lost most of its territory and only held 2% of what it used to occupy by December 2017. In October 2019, the prominent ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed himself during a raid conducted by US special forces.

After territorial control declined, the terrorist organization outsourced their online activities and started to rely on specialized groups, **forming an online cyber terrorist network**. These are the organizations that are known to have been involved in supporting ISIL operations online.

These organizations have had different roles. For example, Cyber Caliphate Army, Islamic State Hacking Division, Islamic Cyber Army and most recently United Cyber Caliphate have been **hijacking or defacing websites** and social media accounts; they have also **disrupted systems and networks** of ordinary people and businesses and have used cyberspace to **spread ISIL’s propaganda**. Other groups have supplied ISIL with **technical support** and **provided training** to adepts willing to join.

Despite the killing of its historical leader Osama Bin Laden in May 2011, **al-Qaeda** still has an online presence through three main components: the al-Qaeda Alliance Online, Youni Tsoulis (an e-jihadist), and the al-Qaeda Electronic. Al-Qaeda has been using cyberspace similarly to ISIL: to **spread jihadist literature**, to **create fundraising campaigns**, to use social media and **spread propaganda**, to incite to violence, to **deliver military training** to carry out violent attacks, to **glorify martyrdom** and the sacrifices of Islamic combatants and finally to **provide instructions** on computer security measures. One specific example of al-Qaeda online activities has been the publication of the English-periodical Inspire, which has been publicly exposing and spreading the organization’s viewpoints. In terms of more specific disruptive capabilities, the al-Qaeda online network has allegedly been responsible for web defacements, DoS attacks, minor data breaches and the establishment and promotion of online forums where to learn how to hack.

But despite all these efforts and groups one question remains: Do terrorist groups pose a threat to critical national infrastructures? We will debate this on the following page.

## Assessing the Evidence: Is There a Threat to CNI Posed By Terrorist Groups?

A [study by Gross, Canetti and Vashdi (2017)](https://academic.oup.com/cybersecurity/article/3/1/49/2999135) has shown that exposure (in the form of video clips) to lethal and non-lethal cyber terrorism generate a “stress-based cyber terrorism effect”.

**Exposure to cyber terrorism** is not harmless and leads to reactions similar to conventional terrorism, such as:

- stress
- anxiety
- insecurity, a preference for security over liberty
- a re-evaluation of confidence in public institutions
- a heightened perception of risk and support for forceful government policies

This leads into support for internet surveillance, regulation of the internet and kinetic responses to terrorism.

However, what is the current assessment of the threat posed by cyber terrorists?

According to the Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community:

<Quote cite="p. 6">
  Terrorists could obtain and disclose compromising or personally identifiable information through cyber operations, and they may use such disclosures
  to coerce, extort, or to inspire and enable physical attacks against their victims. Terrorist groups could cause some disruptive effects—defacing
  websites or executing denial-of-service attacks against poorly protected networks—with little to no warning.”
</Quote>

Generally speaking, there is a **consensus among experts that terrorist groups’ ability to launch major and large scale cyber attacks is lower compared to that of state actors**.

There are **two main reasons** for this assessment:

- Terrorists seem unable to develop new malware. Rather, they resort to what is already available.
- Perpetrating a major attack against a CNI would require not only advanced network operations skills, but also engineering expertise. These forms of expertise and skills could be hard to assemble for terrorist organizations.

However, because of the fast changes in technology and the possibility to acquire complex exploits from more sophisticated actors, cyber terrorists need continuous monitoring.

## Tackling Terrorism Online: How the US Cyber Command Disrupted the ISIL Online Network

In the context of the international military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the US military launched a cyber operation to dismantle the terrorist organization's ability to operate in cyberspace.

The task assigned to task force **JTF-ARES** was to curb ISIL activities in cyberspace. Instead, **Operation Glowing Symphony** tried to curb ISIL social media and internet propaganda.

Today, it is unknown whether Glowing Symphony is still ongoing, although it is known that JTF-ARES still operates.

Glowing Symphony and JTF-ARES activities are seen as a demonstration of the nation’s offensive cyber capability and a model describing the [“American way” of conducting cyber warfare](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/the-american-way-of-cyber-warfare-and-the-case-of-isis/).

## Operation Glowing Symphony: An Assessment

The [National Security Archive](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/cyber-vault/2020-01-21/uscybercom-after-action-assessments-operation-glowing-symphony) (NAS) obtained documents assessing the first phase of Operation Glowing Symphony.

**Outcome** of the operation:

- The operation is assessed to have “imposed time and resource costs” by disrupting activities, leading USCYBERCOM to assess “that OGS successfully contested ISIL in the information domain.”

However **challenges** were also highlighted:

- shortcomings in **data exploitation capabilities**, mostly related to storage of the data itself
- problems in **targeting procedures** (clearing targets for engagement)
- **coordination** with other US agencies and departments
