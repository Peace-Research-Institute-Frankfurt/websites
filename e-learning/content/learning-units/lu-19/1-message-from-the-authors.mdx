Hello there, my name is Niklas Sch√∂rnig and I am head of the Peace Research Institute Frankfurt Research Group on Emerging Technologies, Order and Stability.

Hi, my name is Tommaso De Zan and I am a PhD candidate in Cyber Security at the University of Oxford. I also regularly collaborate with ENISA, the EU Cyber Security Agency, on topics related to the cyber security skills shortage and skills development.

In this learning unit, we will guide you through the confusing fields of security-related cyber incidents. The first chapter, where I will be your host, focuses on conceptual work and definitions, as well as legal aspects of cyber incidents. The second chapter gets more technical and looks at the differences between classical weapons and cyber weapons and why these differences have a severe impact on the implementation of classical arms control concepts.

I will then take the lead in chapters 3, 4 and 5. In chapter 3, I will analyse the cyber defence strategies of major international players, including China, Russia, the UK and the US. In addition, I will explain how cyber operations are often part of wider information warfare strategies. In chapter 4, I will discuss the threat of cyber terrorism and threats to critical national infrastructure. I will talk extensively about the operations of two designated terrorist organisations such as ISIL/Daesh and al-Qaeda and how they have been thwarted by the US cyber command. Finally, in chapter 5, I will talk about EU cyber security policies, with a particular focus on measures in the foreign, security and defence realms.

We hope that you will enjoy our learning unit.
