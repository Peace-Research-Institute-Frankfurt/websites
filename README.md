## Workflow

### Setting up your development environment

You only need to do these steps once. If you've never worked in software engineering before, you might want to read this [gentler introduction](https://awesomephant.github.io/untitled-coding-workshop/chapters/tools/) to the process before you get started.

1. Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [git,](https://git-scm.com/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Sign up for a free [Github](https://github.com/) account using your work email and let an admin know what your username is, so they can add you to [our organisation](https://github.com/Peace-Research-Institute-Frankfurt). You must enable Two-Factor-Authentication to join our organisation.
3. Once youâ€™ve accepted your invitation, run `git clone https://github.com/Peace-Research-Institute-Frankfurt/websites.git` to make a local copy of this repository
5. Open the folder in VS Code
6. Run `npm install` to download and install dependencies (this might take a few minutes)

### How to make changes

1. Open the project folder in VS Code
2. Run `npm run start` in the built-in command line to start a live preview server at `localhost:8000`.
3. Make your changes
4. Use the command line or the version control panel in VS Code to `commit` and `push` your changes to the repository. Your changes should be automatically deployed in about 60 seconds.

## Project structure

As an editor, you'll mostly work inside the `/content` folder of your project.
