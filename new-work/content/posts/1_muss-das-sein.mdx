<Leadin>In principle</Leadin>, the philospoher Walter Benjamin wrote in 1936, the work of art has always been reproducible. 2 People throughout
history, he argued, made images in multiples: The ancient Greeks mass-produced pictures of their rulers by striking them into coins, which they spread
across the continent. Around the third century, Chinese cloth-makers began to carve images into wooden blocks, which they covered in ink and pressed
against silk, leaving a coloured impression that could be repeated over and over. The technique spread, and soon artists in every town were churning
out thousands of playing cards, religious icons, portraits, and scenes from nature and everyday life. Woodblock printing was joined by copperplate
engraving in the 15th, lithography in the 18th, and photography in the 19th century, each time increasing the veracity and speed with which images
could be reproduced.

The current stage of this development is the digital image, where even the simple act of looking entails multiple acts of reproduction. When you open an image on your computer, it’s copied from your computer’s hard drive into its working memory, parsed and translated, until a specific array of pixels in your screen is lit up to render the image. As soon as you close the window, those pixels are turned off and the picture you were looking at is destroyed, only to be produced afresh the next time you open it. When the image is stored online (as NFTs typically are), this process happens everytime anyone looks at it.
